<h2><a name="ACKNOWLEDGMENTS" id="ACKNOWLEDGMENTS">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</a></h2>

<p>This volume is the result of an effort to bring together
in close relation with fundamental principles
of design a variety of practical problems which are
more or less closely connected with the general
problem of home decoration and suited to the constructive
ability of boys and girls from twelve to
eighteen years of age. While the book is mainly
a record of the author's experience and observation
in this department of educational work, he has
received many suggestions from co-workers in the
same field. It will be impossible to give credit to
all who have directly or indirectly assisted in the
preparation of this book: but special acknowledgments
are due to Mr. Fred M. Watts, who furnished
the material for the chapter on Pottery and several
drawings for other parts of the book; to Miss Grace
L. Bell for the illustrations and descriptions embodied
in the chapter on Block Printing; to Mr.
Burton A. Adams for the problems in metal work;
to Mr. Edwin A. Finch and Mr. Lewis O. Richardson
who contributed many of the specifications for the
problems in furniture-making; to Miss Elizabeth
M. Morton for specific suggestions pertaining to
the subject of dress as related to the principles
of decoration; and to Mrs. Ruth B. S. Flower, of
Florence, Mass., who supplied several of the photographs
and much of the descriptive matter for the
chapter on Weaving.</p>

<small>INTRODUCTORY</small></h2>

<h3>THE STORY OF A HOUSE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">To design</span>, plan, and build a house is a task
that rarely falls to the lot of boys and girls.
In fact, it is not the common experience
of men and women to build houses without the aid
of architects, masons, and carpenters. Such a task,
however, was recently offered to certain classes in
one of the public schools of a well-known New England
city. It was, indeed, a school problem, and
yet there was something about it that seemed to
suggest larger and more interesting things than are
ordinarily dealt with in the school-room. It did
not seem at all like some school work. It was more
like real life; for all boys and girls must some day
have homes of their own, and here was a chance
to learn how the house, which is an important
part of every home, is planned and built. It is
hardly necessary to say that this work&mdash;or play,
if you like that word better&mdash;was undertaken with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
genuine enthusiasm. It was a task crammed full of
the pleasure of interest and of accomplishment&mdash;full
of the joy of doing something worth while&mdash;from
the beginning to the end.</p>

<p><i>The House a Work of Art.</i>&mdash;One of the first lessons
learned by these young builders&mdash;perhaps the
most important one of all&mdash;was that a great many
things have to be thought of in planning a house,
if the thing is to be well done. It is not simply
a question of deciding how many rooms one will
have, arranging them in some conventional order,
and building the house around them with whatever
external features style or fancy may dictate. Too
many houses, it is true, are planned, or at least
put up, in this thoughtless fashion; and whatever
goes into them in decoration or furniture is generally
chosen either for necessary use or for display&mdash;not
with any thought of the real comfort and
satisfaction that come from artistic surroundings.
People who are satisfied with such dwellings seem
to show less appreciation of art, the highest product
of civilization, than those uncivilized tribes who
decorated their caves or huts with beautiful rugs
of their own weaving and who ornamented their
pottery and their utensils and implements with
wonderfully conceived and elaborately wrought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
designs. Modern cave dwellers in apartment
houses with all the conveniences of their ready-made
surroundings, are in danger of missing that self-expression
in their home belongings that encouraged
and delighted even the savage. The most extreme
example of this form of degeneracy is found in the
suggestion of a certain great inventor, that the
age of concrete construction, now at hand, means
that we are to have concrete houses poured into a
standard mould, hardened in twenty-four hours,
and finished for occupancy in a day or two.</p>

<p>The boys and girls of this story would not have
accepted a machine-made, standardized house if
one had been offered them, ready for use. There
was a special purpose for which their house was to
be planned and built, as there generally is in the
case of any real house. No style A, B, or C, chosen
from any series of pattern-built or moulded houses,
could fulfil such a purpose; and even if it could,
would they willingly give up all the fun of planning
and building and furnishing? Would they forego
the lessons of experience to be learned from all
this work? This is always a large part of the
satisfaction which comes to any one who builds
his own house. In the present instance it was the
chief motive, since the boys and girls who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
planning this house were not expecting to make
their home there.</p>

<p><i>Why the House Was Built.</i>&mdash;What, then, was the
purpose for which this house was to be built; and
what were the specific problems involved in realizing
this purpose? It was to be a practice house
for the girls of the household technology course.
This meant that it should be, so far as possible,
a model house; but it must of necessity be a simple
one. Economy, always a safe guide, was a most
important factor in determining the character
of the design. A limited appropriation&mdash;about
$1000&mdash;for building material was available. Economy
of space as well as of expense was also important.
The only available land was a triangular
lot in the corner of the school yard, 665 square feet
in area. This limited the dimensions of the floor plan
to 24 by 35 feet. It was decided to develop the design
within these dimensions, on a rectangular plan, with
one story and a hip roof, because such a design would
present comparatively easy problems in framing and
insure a building of pleasing external proportions.</p>


<h3>THE GENERAL DESIGN AND THE PLAN</h3>

<p>In attacking the problem of design the method
of approach was determined by the fact that school-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
girls and school-boys were to be the architects and
builders. House planning, home decoration, and
household management were important subjects of
study on the part of the girls and various forms of
drawing and constructive work were required of all
the boys of this school; so they all felt that they
had a right to contribute something out of their
study and experience that might be of value in
working out this problem. The design must therefore
be a composite of the best features of many studies.</p>

<p><i>A Composite Design.</i>&mdash;The rooms required for a
house of this character were thought to be a hall,
a living room, a dining-room, a kitchen, a pantry,
a bedroom with a closet, a bath room, and a linen
closet. Nothing short of this outfit of rooms would
satisfy the demands of a house to be used to give
practical training in all the essentials of plain
housekeeping and in the entertainment of guests.
With these requirements in mind and with full
knowledge of all the limitations of the problem,
the girls of the junior and senior classes, who were
taking the course in household technology, entered
into a lively but friendly competition with each
other to produce the most acceptable design and
draw the best plan. So many excellent plans resulted
from this competition that it was difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to select the best. It was therefore decided to
combine in a new and final plan the best features
of several studies that seemed to meet the conditions
of the problem with equal success. Two
of these were selected as having the greatest number
of good points. From these the final floor plan
was developed and the necessary modifications
made in the original drawings to make the general
design of the building fit the plan.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_022.jpg" width="600" height="525" alt="Floor plan of the model house" />
<div class="caption">Floor plan of the model house</div>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<i>The Hall.</i>&mdash;It may be of interest to note how some
of the details of the problem of design were worked
out for the final plan. Beginning with the hall,
it was easily seen that economy of space required
that the room should have small dimensions. In
fact, it did not need to be a separate room at all.
It could easily be a space between the living room
and the dining-room, separated from both by means
of porti&egrave;res and joined upon occasion with either
room or with both, thus making possible a reception
room or a dining-room of good size, or one large
room. Of course, the central idea of a hall must
not be lost sight of in providing for a desirable
extension of other rooms. It should suggest a
warm welcome to the guest; and here is where the
fireplace may fulfil the double function of giving
the cheer of the hearth-stone at all times and the
comfort of fire when warmth is needed. The
absence of a stairway, since none was needed, was
a favourable circumstance. Appropriate decoration
and furnishing in due time were to add a
few distinguishing marks so that the house could
retain, without any appreciable sacrifice of space,
the dignity of an entrance hall.</p>

<p><i>The Living Room and the Dining-room.</i>&mdash;The relative
positions of the living room and the dining-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
as already stated, were determined by the
location of the hall. The purpose of each was distinct
and self-evident, and determined the features
of design that lent themselves most readily to
appropriate decoration. In the living room the
floor, the wall spaces, and the ceiling needed consideration
with regard to their final treatment, to
give pleasing proportions and harmonious colouring.
The same was true of the dining-room, though
its different purpose suggested a different design.
An abundance of light was important for both
rooms, hence the large, multiple windows. Such
windows would also offer a good chance for pleasing
drapery effects.</p>

<p><i>The Kitchen and Its Appointments.</i>&mdash;No room
demanded so much study as the kitchen. In the
first place it was necessary to make provision for
a relatively larger kitchen than would ordinarily
be needed in a house of this size, because in this
case it was designed to be used as a practice kitchen
and must therefore be large enough to accommodate
a considerable number of girls&mdash;at least
eight&mdash;at one time. This point assumed so much
importance in the minds of the young designers
that they were constantly tempted to rob other
rooms of the space that was due them in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
get a "nice, big kitchen." But by clever adjustments
and combinations the necessary floor dimensions
were secured without unduly cramping other
features of the plan. The range, laundry tubs,
and sink were conveniently located near each other
with the tubs at such a height that when not in
use the cover was flush with the top of the range,
forming a shelf on which kettles and other kitchen
utensils could be easily placed as they were moved
back and forth from the range. It was thought
that it would be very desirable, if not necessary, to
have this shelf covered with zinc or some kind of
sheet metal.</p>

<p>It will be noted as a possible fault in the plan
that the range is very near the door into the passageway
leading to the bedroom, the living room,
and the hall. This point received due consideration;
but in view of the compensating advantages
the arrangement was thought allowable, inasmuch
as the door into the passageway would be used
only occasionally. There seemed to be no more
convenient location for the passageway, which was
designed to give privacy to bedroom and bath
room and, in cases of sickness or any emergency
requiring it, easy communication between the
kitchen and the bedroom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
<i>Special Features.</i>&mdash;The pantry was located between
the kitchen and the dining-room for obvious
reasons&mdash;to give easy communication in serving
and to confine kitchen odours to their proper place.
In place of a kitchen closet a cabinet was provided
for as being on the whole the more serviceable
of the two. It is always desirable to have an
entry or lobby, with a convenient part of it reserved
for the refrigerator; but the need of providing as
much room as possible in the kitchen itself seemed
to justify the omission of the lobby. Another
unusual feature&mdash;this time not an omission&mdash;is
to be found in the window of the bedroom closet.
Such a window, although not common, was thought
to be very desirable on sanitary grounds and as a
possible protection against moths.</p>

<p><i>Early Plans for Decorating and Furnishing.</i>&mdash;These
were by no means all the features of design that
had to be considered. As already suggested, there
was much study given to the question of interior
decoration and furnishing, even at this early stage.
This was simply necessary forethought; for much
of the attractiveness, restfulness, and homelike
atmosphere of any house is created by the architect,
who, in his arrangement of rooms, door-ways,
and windows, disposes his wall areas so that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
may be divided symmetrically and lend themselves
naturally to colour toning, offering tempting spaces
for a few choice pictures and opening up beautiful
vistas. Such house-planning, begun with clear
vision and followed with taste and delicacy in every
detail, may often lead to a harmony of effects as
pleasing to people of artistic temperament as a
symphony is to those who enjoy a fine musical
composition. In fact, the parallel between sympathetic
gradations of form and colour and harmony
of musical tones is a very close one, and the
appreciation of it is by no means rare. Any intelligent
person, on seeing a suite of rooms designed
and arranged by a real artist, though he may not
understand why, will be impressed by the rhythm
of space divisions, the harmony of colours, the lack
of any jarring or discordant notes in the decoration,
the simplicity, fitness, and real beauty, not of any particular
part, perhaps, but of the whole combination.
We often find ourselves using the same language
whether we are describing the work of an artist-architect
or the work of a musical composer.</p>


<h3>FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN</h3>

<p><i>Adaptation to Purpose.</i>&mdash;Our young architects
discovered that there are certain fundamental
principles or laws that must be observed at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
very beginning, if a really good and true design is
to be made. The first of these laws is the <i>law
of adaptation to purpose</i>. The application of this
law was illustrated in the location of the various
rooms in the plan of the house, in the dimensions
agreed upon for each, and in the details of arrangement,
especially in the kitchen and other rooms
connecting with it. But this law is universal in
its application. It determines not only the broad
features of the plan but the details as well. It
does not permit anything useless or superfluous
to exist, for that would mean weakness. It aims
at efficiency and strength. It dictates the details
of construction all along the line, from the framing
of the building to its finish and its decoration. It
even determines the character of the furniture and
the amount of it. Adaptation to purpose is a
ruling principle.</p>

<p><i>Simplicity.</i>&mdash;Another great principle that revealed
itself as the plans of the house developed
may be called the <i>law of simplicity</i>. This is one
of the elementary laws of nature transferred to the
realm of craftsmanship. It is an axiom of geometry
that the straight line is the shortest distance between
two points. Not less evident is the fact that
when Nature undertakes to do anything she goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
about it in the simplest and most direct way. The
natural tendency of all motion is along a straight
line&mdash;so reads the first law of motion. Analyze
the most complex forms and processes of nature and
we shall find them due to the harmonious combination
of the simplest elementary lines and movements.
But the same law of simplicity which
invariably marks the works of nature gives strength
and beauty also to the works of man. Thus, in
discussing the various problems that developed
as the designing of the house progressed, it was
found&mdash;as of course it should have been&mdash;that
the solution which met the test of simplicity, while
satisfying the law of adaptation to purpose, was the
true one.</p>

<p><i>Correlation.</i>&mdash;A third great fundamental principle
that found expression in these studies of the
house plans was the <i>principle of correlation</i>. Not
only must each part of the design be adapted to
its use in the simplest possible manner, but it must
support all other parts and receive support in
return. It is like cooperation or team-work in
play or in the practical affairs of life. Every room
in a house bears some natural relation to every
other room, and even the objects in the same room
or in adjoining rooms must assist each other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
whether their purpose be utility or decoration or
a combination of both. Only by due attention
to the mutual relations of the various elements
that must enter into the composition, can the
designer produce those pleasing space effects, those
blendings of colour tones, those manifest relations
between the various objects, useful or decorative,
that give order, unity, and sympathetic feeling to
a complete design.</p>


<h3>THE COLOUR SCHEME</h3>

<p><i>The Floor the Foundation.</i>&mdash;Almost unconsciously
our young architects found themselves under the
guidance of these three great fundamental principles
of design. When they came to the problem
of specifying the finish for the floors and other
wood work of the hall, living room, and dining-room,
they found that this problem was intimately associated
with the larger question of the colour
scheme as a whole. The mutual dependence of all
the elements concerned could not be overlooked.
It was evident that the floor, which is the foundation
of the room, should be darker than the walls
and ceiling and the general tone of the furnishings,
in order to give the suggestion of sufficient weight
and firmness for the support of the entire room and
all it might contain. The effect of solidity could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
be produced by staining the floor boards or by providing
a liberal supply of dark, rich-toned rugs, large
ones as well as small ones. There was no question
of carpets. These, of course, are not allowable in
a model house. A few rugs were already available,
and others could be procured by buying them or by
making them. A properly toned floor, however,
is desirable, even with a most generous covering
of rugs. It was therefore decided to give the floor
a coat of stain when it was ready to be finished.</p>

<p><i>Importance of Colour Schemes.</i>&mdash;But what was the
colour to be? The designers were thus brought
face to face with that difficult but important problem
which all who plan houses have to solve before
they can hope to bring their work into harmonious
adjustment with the various natural and
human conditions that must be satisfied in the
final product, if it be made a good example of the
designer's art. The problem of the colour scheme
is fundamental. Upon this depends not only the
tone of the floors, the walls, and the ceilings, but also,
to a certain extent, as has already been suggested,
the kind of woods to be used in the interior finishing,
and whether they are to be painted, stained, or
left in their natural colours. It will determine
the material and the colours of the porti&egrave;res, curtains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
cushions, lamp shades, picture frames, vases;
in fact, it will largely settle the decorative character
of every article placed in the rooms. The consideration
of movable objects, however, may be deferred
till the more substantial and fixed elements are
decided upon.</p>

<p><i>Southern Exposures and Cool Colours.</i>&mdash;In settling
the all-important question of the colour scheme
the first point to be considered was the location
of the rooms with reference to light and to external
surroundings. Rooms that have a southern exposure
and nothing to interfere with their being flooded
with sunlight need to be protected against the glare
of too much light. For such rooms dull tones of
colour are the best&mdash;dull browns, soft gray-greens, certain
blue tones, and the medium grays&mdash;light, cool
colours that counteract the overbrilliancy of direct
sunlight and give a positively tempered feeling to
the atmosphere of a room. Incidentally, too,
perhaps because they are the tints associated with
distant views, the cool colours make a room seem
larger than it really is.</p>

<p><i>Northern Exposures and Warm Colours.</i>&mdash;Northern
rooms, on the other hand, do not generally suffer
from excess of sunlight and heat. Warm colours
are needed in such rooms. Deep reds, rich yellows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and golden browns will seem to bring sunlight into
a sunless room. Our designers noted the fact
that many of the rooms in the house they were
planning must be comparatively dark. The house
was to face the high brick walls of the neighbouring
school building, not more than twenty-five feet
distant, and its principal rooms had a northern exposure.
A warm colour treatment, therefore,
was unquestionably needed. Should red, brown,
or yellow be the prevailing tone? The deciding
point was the location of the hall and its relations
to the other rooms. It was, first of all, the
hall, the place of welcome for the guest; but it
was dark. Its walls must have the sunniest
of all colours&mdash;a rich golden yellow. The same
would serve the needs of the living room, or perhaps
a brown with yellow enough in it to be well in tune.
The dining-room could safely be darker and more
luminous, in pleasing contrast with the golden
yellow of the hall; but it must not be decidedly
red. The ceilings of these three rooms, whether
beamed or not, since they must be lighter than the
walls, could have the same or nearly the same tint.
This might well be a light corn yellow.</p>

<p>The colouring of the walls of the bedroom, bath
room, and kitchen was not so important a question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
as the decoration of the three front rooms.
Utility and sanitary conditions were important
things to be considered. Light tints were decided
upon, which in the bedroom might be relieved, in
the finishing touches, by delicate stenciled figures
in some warm tone.</p>

<p><i>Interior Woodwork.</i>&mdash;With the colour scheme
settled it was a comparatively easy matter to
decide what should be the general tone and character
of the interior woodwork. The floors of the
three front rooms, since they were to be closely
associated, required the same solid colour, which
could well be a walnut brown, darker than any of
the walls. Fumed oak trimmings were thought desirable
for the dining-room and gum wood for the
living room, either of which could be extended to
the hall; but ivory white for the living room and the
hall, leaving the oak for the dining-room, found
much favour. It was finally decided, however,
to adopt for the three front rooms the combination
of natural woods first suggested. The bedroom
and bath room, where suggestions of cleanliness
are peculiarly appropriate, were specified to
be finished in white. Yellow southern pine was
decided upon for the kitchen and its accessory
rooms.</p>

<h3>ORGANIZING THE WORK OF CONSTRUCTION</h3>

<p>As soon as the chief features of design were
decided upon, preparations were made for carrying
them out in the actual work of building; for the
house was not to be a "castle in air." The first
step was to put these ideas on paper and work out
the details of construction in clearly executed and
accurately dimensioned drawings. These included,
as the first to be used, the working drawings for
the framing and other rough woodwork, blue print
copies of which were to be put into the hands of
the boys of the elementary vocational school, who
were to carry out this part of the building plans.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_035.jpg" width="601" height="352" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Front or north elevation of the model house</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Working Drawings.</i>&mdash;A considerable number
of detailed drawings had to be made before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
work of construction could be wisely begun. This
furnished an interesting set of problems for the
mechanical drawing groups of the technical high
school. The material for this work consisted of
rough sketches in pencil, but with the correct
dimensions as determined in the plan accepted
as the result of the competition in design. These
preliminary sketches required much study on the
part of both boys and girls, under proper guidance,
in order to find out what the elements of construction
should be, what dimensions were required,
and how the various parts should be put together.
It was an experience of great value to all, but
especially to those boys who were looking forward
to architectural draughting as a possible vocation.
They got an inside view of the importance, on the
one hand, of accurate working drawings as a basis
for good construction and, on the other hand,
a practical illustration of the necessity of a thorough
knowledge of constructive principles, in order to
make correct working drawings. They saw that
the efficient architect must be a builder, acquainted
with all the detailed processes employed by the
carpenter or mason, informed upon all the conditions
to be met, and knowing the best ways of meeting
them. They gained impressions which should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
help them, in studying the work of great architects,
to look beyond the exterior, however pleasing it
may be, for those elements of strength and beauty
that characterize all good workmanship.</p>

<div class="caption">All the Rough Carpentry Was Assigned to Boys of the Woodworking Section
of the Vocational School</div>
<div class="capl">[Plate I]</div>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>How the Work Was Distributed.</i>&mdash;It will be recalled
that boys and girls were to be coworkers
in the designing, planning, and building of the
house. The boys were to be held responsible
for the drawings, the decorating after designs
made by the girls, and the higher grades of
woodwork, including the finishing of the rooms
and the making of the furniture. They were to
do the wiring for the electric lights, the bells, and
the interior telephones; and they were to install
all the fixtures in connection with this wiring.
Boys from the metal-working sections were to do
the necessary piping for gas and water and some
of the work of plumbing; but, since the laws regulating
plumbing are strict and well enforced, as
they should be, it was necessary to keep this
most essential feature of the work under charge of
licensed plumbers. But this requirement did not
remove even the plumbing of the building from the
field of public school work; for, fortunately, this
city has a well-equipped plumbing school in the
trades school department, under the direction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
licensed plumbers of high standing, who were glad
to have given them, as an exercise for their classes,
a practical problem in house plumbing. The boys
in the forging classes were not overlooked in the
distribution of the work on the house. Many of
the fixtures needed for use or ornament were designed
to be made in the school forge shop. The
girls designed and made rugs, curtains, porti&egrave;res,
and cushions as a part of their school work in weaving
and stencilling; and they contributed many
decorative articles in clay, copper, leather, and
other materials. Thus every technical department
of the school was brought into service; for in
the building of a house there is to be found something
to enlist the interest of every boy and girl.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="PLII" id="PLII"></a><img src="images/i_041.jpg" width="600" height="389" alt="" />
<div class="caption">The Boys of the Forging Classes of the Technical High School Were Not Overlooked in the Distribution
of the Work on the House</div>
<div class="capl"> [Plate II]</div>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Boy Foremen in Charge.</i>&mdash;To bring about the right
distribution of the work and to marshal the working
forces effectually required the oversight and management
of an experienced instructor. But much
of the work of direction was delegated to competent
boys. The preliminary tool work in the
school shops had revealed those who were especially
observant and capable as leaders, and those who
worked best under specific directions. Thus the
twenty boys of the vocational school who set the
posts and framed the house worked sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in pairs&mdash;one being the chief foreman and the
other the helper&mdash;sometimes in gangs of three or
four under a foreman. The plan was varied according
to the nature of the work in hand. When
leaders of more technical knowledge and skill were
needed, as was the case in setting the window frames
and directing the shingling, capable boys from the
technical high school were placed in charge of groups
of younger boys from the vocational school. In this
way the work was advanced in several directions at
the same time; and the advantage was not all in the
advancement of the house construction. It was a delightful
and profitable experience for all the boys, not
unlike that which some of them will doubtless repeat
when school days are over and they take their place
in the more serious affairs of life. In after years they
may look back upon the first house that they helped
to build and recall the part they took, their companions
in the work, and the good time they had withal.</p>

<h3>SOME DETAILS OF CONSTRUCTION</h3>

<p><i>Setting Batter Boards, Posts, and Sills.</i>&mdash;The first
step in actual construction was to mark off the lot
and set the batter boards. These were made by
driving three stakes to form a right angle about
four feet from the point where each of the four main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
corners of the house was to be located. Two
rough boards, one for each side of each angle, were
nailed horizontally to each of the four sets of stakes,
with their upper edges all brought to the same
level. It is very important to set these batter boards
with accuracy, since their function is to carry the
lines which mark the dimensions and level of the
ground floor. In the present instance their first
use was to locate the concrete posts on which the
sills of the house were to rest. Twenty-two of
these posts, which were 4 feet long and 8 inches
square, were put in position by first setting moulds
or boxes, the interior dimensions of which were
those of the posts, 3 feet deep in the light soil and
filling them with a mixture of concrete and crushed
rock. It was not thought necessary to remove
the moulds after the hardening of the concrete.
In fact, the sills were framed and placed in position
resting on these boxes before sufficient time had been
given for the concrete to harden. The sides of the
boxes, however, were scored with a saw cut so that
they could be easily broken off just below the ground,
exposing the projecting ends of the concrete posts
for about one foot. The sills were of 6 by 8-inch
first quality spruce. They were set on the 6-inch
face, the two long sills being spliced over posts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
using a long halved joint. Mortise and tenon
joints, draw-bored and pinned, were used at the
corners. The floor timbers of 2 by 8-inch spruce
were gained into the sills with the top faces flush
with the top of the sill and crowning (<i>i. e.</i>, bending)
upward if at all. The spacing of the floor timbers
was taken off at the sill on a strip of furring&mdash;spruce,
<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an inch thick by 2 inches wide&mdash;which
was moved out to the centre near the line
of bridging and lightly nailed, bringing crooked
timbers into line. The bridging was then nailed
in, the outside last to prevent springing the sills.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="600" height="872" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Plan A. Framing details</div>
</div>

<p>Referring to the accompanying sketch (Plan A)
it will be noticed that the corner posts and centres
were not mortised into the sills, but were simply
butted on and heavily nailed or spiked. There was
a time when carpenters would have regarded such
a method as altogether wrong; but those were the
days of great corner posts and heavy studding,
placed two or three times as far apart as is the
practice now. It was thought that placing the
studs 16 inches on centres, which is the common
practice in modern house framing, removed the
necessity of mortising into the sill. Mortising is
still recognized, however, as a good thing to do
and is sometimes practised by first-rate carpenters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Plan A also shows how the outside walls were trussed
over openings; and Plan B shows how the corners
of the building were tied by the lapping of the
double plate, and how the ceiling timbers and rafters
were placed on the top of the plate.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">Plan B. Details of cornice, sill, and roof
</div>
</div>

<p>The window frame details are shown in a series
of cuts (Plan C) which for the sake of completeness
are drawn to show also the interior finish, not
usually represented in the framing drawings. A
detailed description of these features of construction
is unnecessary, since the dimensions and relations
of the various elements and the technical
terms by which they are known are all clearly indicated
in the illustrations.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_049.jpg" width="600" height="788" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Plan C. Details of interior finish
</div>
</div>

<p>In the same series of cuts a detail of the base is
shown which includes the framing, the base board,
and the lath and plaster. It should be stated,
however, that a substitute for lath and plaster was
recommended to the student architects&mdash;a new
product in paper board especially designed for walls
and ceilings, which it was decided to use. The
use of this material removed the necessity of the
"grounds" shown in the drawings and always
needed as a nailing base for the wood trim when
the walls and ceilings are lathed and plastered.
In the detail of the dado cap, which will be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
on the page of construction drawings, the dotted
lines show how the cap was to be expanded into
a plate rail, requiring the addition of brackets
with a bed moulding between, in the finishing of the
walls of the dining-room. Among these drawings
will also be found a detail showing a section of the
beamed ceiling finish.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood that none of the
finishing work called for in the detailed drawings
was begun until the rough carpentry on the house
was practically completed. All the rough work,
which included framing, boarding, shingling, laying
of the lining floors, and putting up partitions,
was assigned to boys of the woodworking sections
of the vocational school. This is an elementary
industrial or trade school, admitting from the
grades below the high school boys who have attained
the age of fourteen years and wish to learn some
mechanical trade. It represents a new and promising
experiment in American education. The
building of this house furnished an excellent opportunity
for the boys of this school to show the honesty
of their purpose in enrolling themselves to learn
the fundamentals of a trade and thus prove their
right to have the chance.</p>

<p>So the house was built by the combined efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of the boys and girls of the public schools of this
New England city, unassisted by professional architects
or paid labourers. How they carried out
with their own hands the designs for decorating
and furnishing the house is told in the succeeding
chapters of this book, which also suggests wider
applications of the principles of household decoration
as possible to be made in the homes of clever
boys and girls throughout the country. To carry
out these suggestions will mean work&mdash;but work
of a kind that gives pleasure to the worker and to
many others. It was work for the young designers
and builders of whom this story tells, but they said
it was "great fun," and there really is no pleasure
quite equal to that found in doing with one's own
hands an exceptionally good thing. The true
craftsmen of all time have found it so. One of
these master workmen, Stradivarius, the violin

<small>DECORATIONS AND FURNITURE</small></h2>

<div class = "blockquot">
<p>Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful, or
believe to be beautiful&mdash;<i>William Morris</i></p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> decorating and furnishing of a house
have their true beginning in good architectural
design. It is a mistake to proceed
upon the theory that decoration necessarily
implies something added for its own sake&mdash;something
beautiful in itself but selected and applied
without regard to the lines, spaces, and colours of
the room in which it is to be placed and without
considering the relation of this room to neighbouring
rooms and to more remote surroundings.
The truth is, a decorative object may or may not
be intrinsically beautiful; but however beautiful
it may be in itself, it finds its truest beauty in an
appropriate setting. And the decorator who is
actuated by the true spirit looks to the architect
for inspiration and finds his greatest successes
in acknowledging that leadership. To attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
lead when one should follow is neither good art nor
good sense.</p>

<p>There is danger, perhaps, that this truth may be
taken too seriously. It would also be a mistake
to run to the other extreme and adopt at the outset
a rigid plan of decoration and furnishing, specified
like contract work to be carried out and completed
on a certain date soon after the house is
built. The problem is one of growing interest,
especially as regards furniture, pictures, and the
smaller objects of use or beauty, and for its best
and happiest solution requires time and study.
Only the broad and fundamental features can
be settled in advance. The important thing is
to have the main lines, dimensions, space relations,
and colour schemes settled with due regard to
utility and appropriateness and, as the work of
construction proceeds, to keep all details in harmony
with this general plan.</p>


<h3>THE FLOORS, THE WALLS, AND THE CEILINGS</h3>

<p><i>Colour Harmony in the Model House.</i>&mdash;It will be
remembered that the colour scheme of the hall,
living room, and dining-room of our model house
was settled quite early in the development of the
design. Standing near the centre of the living
room and looking through the hall into the dining-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
one may see at a glance how some of the
details of decoration were worked out in keeping
with the general treatment. The walnut brown
stain of the floors gives a good foundation of
colour. It flows easily into the lighter browns and
yellows of all the lower wall spaces. The suggestion
of olive green in the frieze of the living
room offers a pleasing contrast with the prevailing
browns and harmonizes well with the woodwork
of this room, which, it will be remembered, was
designed to be finished in gum wood. This beautiful
wood, when properly treated, presents a
surface of satin-like texture and soft colour tone.
In the dining-room a corner of which is shown
in the frontispiece, the frieze lends a warmth of
colour where it is needed and is in keeping with
the fumed oak trim. The wide openings into
the hall from the rooms on each side of it, together
with the long, unbroken lines of the beamed
ceilings, give the impression of generous width.
The plain wall spaces, though varied in tone
and relieved of monotonous spacings by the location
of the necessary doors and windows, are of
great assistance in increasing the apparent size of
the room. Plain walls are also the best of backgrounds
for pictures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
<i>Redecorating Old Houses.</i>&mdash;It is, of course, true
that the decorating and furnishing of a house or
an apartment cannot always have a new and original
architectural design as the basis for the solution
of the problems involved. As a matter of
fact, in the great majority of cases, the houses in
which homes are made are already built and have
been previously occupied. Often they are very
old houses, presenting difficult and even impossible
tasks for the decorator. Sometimes, however,
such houses are all the more desirable if they bear
the marks of age that suggest a past of dignity
and charm. But the spirit which inspires the
artist in decorating and furnishing a house already
built is the same as that which controls his thought
when he can begin with the foundation of a new
and original design. His first thought is to discover
how beauty may be enhanced and at the
same time unity of purpose and harmony of treatment
be preserved. His constant care is to avoid
incongruous elements, however beautiful they may
be in themselves or however appropriate in other
houses. His general aim is to use his art to develop
the design as it is, if there be any design at
all, and make the most of it.</p>

<p><i>Decoration as a Corrective.</i>&mdash;But this does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
prevent him from attempting to counteract the
blunders of faulty design and bad architecture.
Such correction, indeed, forms a large part of
the work of decorators and furnishers, both professional
and amateur. If the lines and space
divisions of a room be not good, the decoration
must be planned with a view to giving the needed
harmony of proportions, or at least the appearance
of it. If the ceiling be too high, it may be
made to "look" lower by carrying the ceiling
paper or tinting one or two feet down the walls
of the room to meet the picture moulding. The
effect of reduced height is accentuated by a high
base board or by wainscoting. If the ceiling be
too low, the depressing effect may be largely overcome
by extending the picture moulding along the
top of the wall spaces close to the ceiling. This
is a desirable thing to do in the living rooms of
most modern houses. Striped wall papers of
proper tones may be used in low rooms with good
effect in increasing their apparent height. Bad
wall spacing may also be corrected by enlarging
door-ways, substituting porti&egrave;res for the doors,
and by arranging the drapery over windows to
give the effect either of increasing or of diminishing
their height, as the conditions may require.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<i>Wall Papers.</i>&mdash;Probably no element of decoration
furnishes so many pitfalls to ensnare the
unwary as wall papers do. It is easy to fall a
victim to a captivating design as it appears in the
few square feet of wall paper displayed on the
dealer's rack. The same interesting figure, spread
out in endless repetition on the four walls of the
living room, may create an atmosphere of unrest
and positive discomfort keenly felt by sensitive
persons. A wise choice cannot be made in the
absence of all the conditions that should really
determine it. After all, it is not the paper which
is beautiful in the roll that should be selected,
but only that which will become beautiful when
hung upon the walls of a certain room. Papers
with large figures should be avoided unless there
is a special reason for using them. They always
have the effect of reducing the apparent size of
everything associated with them. They make a
small room appear dwarfish and a large one over
decorated unless well relieved by plain spaces
harmonizing in colour with the large-figured patterns.
Strong contrasts in colour values should
also be avoided, not only between the designs
and the ground colour of the wall paper itself,
but also between the paper and other objects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
importance in the room. The principle of gradation
in colour values, which does not as a general
thing allow the placing together of light and dark
shades or tints, is almost as important as harmony
of colour tones.</p>

<p><i>Nature of Decorative Design.</i>&mdash;The one fact
never to be lost sight of by the decorator is the
real nature of true decorative design. It is never
a picture. While it may suggest the natural forms
of plants or animals, it does not aim to represent
them in a naturalistic way. Some of the best
decorative designs do not even suggest natural
forms; but, whether they do or not, the central
idea is the repetition of good combinations of
line and form in closely related colours and values
on a flat surface. If natural forms are used, they
should be more or less highly conventionalized.
Anything that destroys the idea of flat surfaces
in the same plane is a false note in wall decoration.
In the nature of the case, a wall can have but one
plane. Clusters of flowers or patterns of any
kind that seem to hang in front of this plane, or
back of it, are out of place and therefore offend
the sense of fitness. Such incongruities are sometimes
so pronounced that they positively shock
the sensibilities of refined people. Extreme examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
have been known to give such pain to sensitive
persons as to drive them from the room.</p>

<p><i>Advantage of Plain Walls.</i>&mdash;Decorative designs,
however, are not essential in wall papers. The
main point in the treatment of walls is to secure
and preserve a good background. If one is in
doubt as to the kind of figure or pattern to be used,
which is often a perplexing question, it is well to
leave them out altogether. Plain walls are always
good if the colour tone is right; for colour
is the main thing in wall decoration. The decorative
effects of form may be brought out in the
porti&egrave;res and window draperies, which may easily
carry more elaborate patterns when associated
with plain walls than is desirable with figured wall
decorations. In fact, with figured walls plain
porti&egrave;res and curtains are much to be preferred.
In our model house, as has been explained, the wall
decorations were designed to offer a plain background
of colour. The figured borders of the
porti&egrave;res and curtains, combined with the careful
gradation in the colouring of the floors, wall spaces,
and ceiling, gave such a variety of tone to this
background that nothing further was needed to
avoid monotony.</p>

<p><i>Trial Needed in Doubtful Cases.</i>&mdash;It is, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
a good rule to omit whatever is unnecessary. To
observe this rule wisely is to escape much that is
positively bad in decoration. Overwrought designs,
too great variety in decorative material,
too many decorative objects, however great their
individual beauty, too many odd pieces of furniture,
too many interesting things in whatever
direction one may turn, create an oppressive and
disquieting atmosphere and a feeling of unrest
which it should always be the aim of home decoration
to dispel. And yet it may not always be best
to set aside our treasures because they do not
seem perfectly suited to the general scheme of
decoration or are not apparently needed to complete
it. It is, in fact, often very difficult to determine
where the line should be drawn between
what is needed and what is not needed. The
fact that nothing seems to be lacking is not a final
test if one has at hand useful or beautiful things
that may be introduced into a scheme of decoration
already well thought out and be given a trial.
Such experimenting will often reveal unsuspected
needs or add a new charm that at once proves
its right to be retained.</p>

<p>To take a step like this, somewhat out of line
with accepted rules as strictly interpreted, is entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
safe if this step is dictated by good taste
and does not lead the young decorator too far
afield. Exceptional treatment of any kind should
show proper restraint, and such restraint, when
it is plainly indicated in any work of art, is in
itself an attractive feature.</p>

<p><i>Precise Rules not Always Practicable.</i>&mdash;The truth
is, the rules of decoration, though founded upon
fundamental principles of art, are not rules of
precision like those founded upon mathematical
principles. In the nature of the case they must
in their application yield more or less to circumstances.
It is, for example, a good general rule
to determine the colour scheme and background
first and accommodate other decorative features
to these as a foundation; and yet it is possible
for a situation to be so exceptional as to justify
a complete reversal of this rule. Here is a concrete
case. A young artist was the fortunate
possessor of a considerable number of Japanese
and Chinese embroideries and other Oriental ornaments.
He wished to make these the main
decorative materials for one of his rooms. The
embroidered figures were in yellow and white
on a deep, strong blue, the general effect being
quite dark. There were in the collection several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
prints, showing the typical dull reds, dark blues,
and yellows of Japanese art. Now the room
itself happened to be one that, under the general
principle of colour schemes as determined by exposure
and other fixed conditions, would demand
warm colours on its walls. It would easily support
a rich red frieze with appropriate combinations
in floor, dado, and ceiling. This would set
off well the dark oak trim and the mahogany furniture,
but it would rule out the Oriental decorations.
One or the other must give way; and,
since the value of these decorative materials was
beyond question, it was decided to try them, even
at the cost of setting aside the general rule. The
whole matter resolved itself into selecting a proper
background for these beautiful pictures and embroideries;
and for these the best colour was a
gray blue&mdash;the coldest of colours. But when the
whole decorative scheme was carried out to completion
and the cold background was fully employed
in setting off the rich colours and exquisite
workmanship of the Oriental prints and draperies,
all the circumstances that ordinarily determine
the choice of backgrounds were forgotten in the
charm of originality. No one thought of the
exposure as requiring warm colours, the dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
oak trim was not noticed, and the mahogany furniture
was still in keeping. The result was so
absolutely satisfying that no one who saw it could
question the good taste displayed in this very
original plan of decoration.</p>

<p>But such exceptional cases should not shake
our confidence in the fundamental principles of
decoration. It is true that these principles cannot
be reduced to formulas to be applied invariably
in all cases, and it is unreasonable to assume
that any form of treatment is the only one possible
in any given case. Modifications in the application
of these principles are always possible,
but the principles themselves are as unalterable
as the Mosaic law. One is, indeed, tempted to
summarize them thus as the</p>


<h3>TEN COMMANDMENTS OF DECORATION</h3>
<div class="blockquotl">
<p>Thou shalt have no household gods except those that be
beautiful or those that be useful.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not make unto thyself any likeness that is in
the heaven above or in the earth beneath, or in the waters
under the earth, that does not find an appropriate setting in
thine house.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not look in vain upon the creations of the great
masters of decorative art.</p>

<p>Remember the colour scheme and keep a good background.</p>

<p>Honour the original design, however old it may be, and make
the most of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Thou shalt not hesitate to correct the blunders of faulty
design and bad architecture.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not kill thy neighbours or thy friends with over-decorated
wall papers or oppressive decorations of any kind.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not bring together incongruous articles nor
permit insane arrangements of anything that is thine.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not permit any false note to mar the harmony
of thy decorations.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not imitate thy neighbour's house or anything
that is thy neighbour's, for it is the glory of the good decorator
to show originality but at the same time to acknowledge
his dependence upon those who have preceded him.</p></div>


<h3>THE FURNITURE</h3>

<p><i>Relation of Furniture to Decoration.</i>&mdash;So much
for the treatment of floors, walls, and ceilings.
We may now turn to the more special consideration
of those objects of use or beauty that are
to be associated with these backgrounds&mdash;furniture,
pictures, lamp shades, and small ornaments.
That these are closely related to decoration
has been implied in all that has been said. They
are, in fact, in themselves elements in the decorative
scheme and as such must obey the same
laws. Their value, however, depends more or
less upon their utility, and for this reason they
seem to require consideration somewhat apart
from their merely decorative functions. This is
especially true of furniture, which would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
very little reason for being if it were not for its
usefulness.</p>

<p>In designing the furniture for the model house
the questions that constantly suggested themselves
were: What is this piece of furniture under consideration
to be used for? What form, construction,
and finish will enable it to give the best service?
What features of design are needed to render
it suited to its surroundings? In considering
the furniture for the model house it was most
natural to apply these tests to the various rooms in
order.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Hall of the Model House.</i>&mdash;First, there is the
hall. This is the room into which a visitor is
first admitted, and from its atmosphere he gets
his first impressions. But in this house it is a
very small room and designed to serve not merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
as a place for the formalities of welcome but also
as an expansion of the rooms on either side. Its
furniture must consist largely of the fireplace.
There is no room for a hall settle nor even for a
chair. A mirror,
simply but richly
framed, might hang
on the wall near the
front door, balanced
by a picture on the
opposite wall behind
the door. An umbrella
rack should stand
outside on the porch.</p>

<div class="caption">A hall settle&mdash;simplicity, strength, dignity</div>
</div>

<p><i>Hall Furniture in
General.</i>&mdash;The halls
of modern houses
vary greatly in their
relative importance.
In some the traditions
of the old English
manor houses
seem partially to survive.
In medi&aelig;val England the hall was the principal
room, if not the only one comfortably furnished.
When modern houses combine the living room and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
library or reception room with the hall, there is need
of something more than hall furniture of the formal
kind. The requirements of comfort must be met.
But, generally speaking, hall furniture is of little
real use. Odd chairs, attractive by reason of their
oddity, the richness of the materials used in their
construction, or some other assertive quality, but
not fit to sit in, are suitable or at least excusable
in the hall. The hat and coat rack of our fathers
has been declared insane and no longer appears
in well-regulated houses. In place of it is found
the hall settle, which is of real use. It should
be designed on simple lines and give the impression
of strength and dignity. If the hall is to
be used as a waiting room for guests, a few good
chairs, conveniently placed, will be needed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
their comfort and a choice picture or two on the
walls will add greatly to their pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Living Room Furniture.</i>&mdash;In furnishing living rooms
there is bound to be a wide range for the exercise
of good taste because
of the variety
of needs to be met and
the large facilities
afforded in the markets
for meeting these
needs with due regard to
artistic requirements.
It will be quite impossible
to go into detail
in discussing so large a topic. The important
thing is to keep in mind the central idea of
a living room&mdash;the place of all places where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the freedom, comfort, and protection of home
life are to be enjoyed. The very atmosphere
of the room should suggest simplicity, sincerity,
and good cheer. Every article of furniture should
be there to serve a genuine need, and it should
be strong enough to do its full duty. Spider-legged,
top-heavy tables; light, weak chairs; chairs
on casters or rockers; sofas with carved backs or
couches with none at all,&mdash;these have no place
in the living room. The long, straight lines of the
craftsman or mission style of furniture are in the
right direction; but if these be used at all they
must be made quite general, since few other styles
harmonize with them. Wicker or reed furniture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
is a notable exception. When well designed it
will fit in almost anywhere.</p>

<div class="caption">A plain but useful magazine stand</div>
</div>

<p>The frequent combination of the library with
the living room requires a suitable adjustment of
the furniture to this use. A plain, serviceable
magazine rack, which may be easily made, will
relieve the tables of an accumulation of weeklies
and monthlies. Moderately low bookcases, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
or without doors, are to be preferred to the more
ordinary high ones because this form harmonizes
better with the lines of a room, which are generally
longer horizontally than vertically. If doors are
used, it is well to break up the glare of the glass
by heavy sash, the spacing of which may be arranged
in a very pleasing manner. Good design
in library tables calls for ample size. Firmness
and convenience as well as satisfactory proportions
should control the choice of a writing desk.</p>

<p><i>Dining-room Furniture.</i> Only a few elements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
enter into the design for the furnishing of a
dining-room; but they are evident and should have
a controlling influence. The table and chairs are
for a definite purpose and this should show itself
in good design. Heavy construction is permissible
since the chairs are to be moved but little
and the table is practically stationary. Moreover,
weight and generous dimensions are suggestive of
bounty and good service. The rectangular extension
table is most readily adjusted to varied demands,
but the round table is preferable for the family circle;
and for a company of twelve or fifteen a large,
round, temporary table top, placed on an ordinary
extension table, has been found very attractive.</p>

<div class="caption">A sideboard of good proportions. Convenient and generous but not overdone</div>
</div>

<p>As comfort is the chief result to be obtained in
furnishing a living room, so richness, within one's
means, is an appropriate aim in furnishing a dining-room.
The history of sideboard design might
be cited in proof of this statement, if proof were
needed. Probably no single article of furniture
has been subjected to greater elaboration; but
the desirable suggestion of plenty with convenience
may be secured without overdoing it. The
unique purpose of the sideboard makes it an interesting
study for one who wishes to design and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
construct his own in conformity with the architecture
of his dining-room. The buffet or serving
table furnishes an equally interesting, though
simpler, problem.</p>

<div class="caption">A buffet of simple but effective design</div>
</div>

<p>For the care of the china, the built-in cabinet
as a feature of the architecture of the room is to be
preferred to the movable cabinet designed for this
purpose, because of its richer decorative possibilities.
Large, glazed doors are desirable in either case,
not for the full display of china and glassware but
to give a suggestive glimpse of it. As this cabinet
is for decoration and not for show, it is well to avoid
plain glass doors unbroken by sash. Leaded panes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
are frequently employed with good effect. The
decorative effect of old and odd pieces of china&mdash;not
too many of them&mdash;is most appropriately
employed by the use of the plate rail; but it is
better to leave the plate rail bare than to load it
with commonplace crockery and inappropriate
ornaments.</p>

<p><i>Chamber Furniture.</i>&mdash;The bedroom speaks for
itself. A dainty freshness in all its appointments
is conducive to sleep and rest, which it is the distinctive
purpose of this room to provide. The
necessary articles of furniture are a bed, a dressing
table, a bureau or chiffonier, a few chairs, and, if
there be no bath room attached, a commode or
wash stand. A couch is an appropriate addition;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and here, if anywhere, rocking chairs are allowable.
When the bedroom must be used more or
less as a living room or sewing
room, as it too often unfortunately
is, furniture to serve such
uses must be provided. In selecting
or designing all this furniture,
lightness, and simplicity
of design, combined with
strength, should be allowed a
controlling influence. The recognition
of this idea has given
great popularity to the brass
or iron beds; but it is possible
to design and construct beds of
oak, maple, or other woods that
harmonize with the rest of the
furniture, carry out the idea of daintiness, and have
sufficient strength for service.</p>

<p>Many of these suggestions on furniture design
are being carried out in fitting up the model house
described in our introductory chapter. A small
house like this, limited to one story, does not permit
great variety in its furnishings. Certain standard
conditions, however, were to be met here, as
everywhere else, and the young designers found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
much pleasure and great profit in working out the
furniture problems. Some of the construction details
will be given in
the later chapters.</p>

<h3>ARRANGEMENT OF THE FURNITURE</h3>

<p><i>Arrangement Follows
Selection.</i>&mdash;The problem
of furnishing a
home is not fully settled
when the questions
of design have
been answered and
the right selections
made. After selection comes arrangement, or,
to speak more accurately, after a certain amount
of selection a certain amount of arrangement;
for, as has already been suggested, there is considerable
dependence of one upon the other.
It is not wise to drop the arrangement till
the selection is complete, for the simple reason
that the happiest choices are often the late ones,
determined by the disposition of the earlier ones.
And yet in the main the order as stated is the
true one. It should be noted, too, that in arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
there is a larger field for the exercise of individuality
and taste. While artistic principles still
hold sway, they yield more readily to exceptional
interpretation by the ruling spirit of the household,
to the demands of style, and to the larger
number of possibilities for pleasing effects when
the question is one of the arrangement of things
already well chosen for their usefulness and for
their artistic value.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_078.jpg" width="500" height="377" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A dainty bed in white maple</div>
</div>

<p><i>Utility the Controlling Principle.</i>&mdash;The problems
of arrangement, however, are by no means vague
and uncertain. The natural law of adaptation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to purpose is not difficult to follow. In some rooms
obedience to it has become a settled custom. No
one, for example, would think of placing the dining
table in any other place than the centre of the
dining-room or, if the room be a long one, in the
centre of one end. The sideboard, serving table,
and china closet likewise fall into their natural
places. So also the bedroom and the hall, though
perhaps to a less degree, present comparatively
easy problems in furniture arrangement when due
regard is paid to the purposes for which such rooms
are designed.</p>

<p><i>Importance of Appropriateness.</i>&mdash;But it is in the
library and the living room that we find the most
difficult and at the same time the most interesting
problems. And this is due to the operation of the
same law of adaptation to purpose. It is the
variety of uses and the diversity of useful objects
that make the problem somewhat complex. However
refined and beautiful the different units may
be, there must be some arrangement of them into
working groups. The important elements should
dominate and those of lesser importance should
fall naturally into related but subordinate places.
The easy corner with its couch, pillows, and its
low seats, has a definite function to perform. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
also have the piano and the music rack, the bookcases
and library table, the Morris chairs and
tabourettes, the window seats and screens, the writing
desk and its proper lighting by window or lamp,
the fireplace and all the accessories of comfort
that may belong to it. The various centres of
interest should be accentuated by grouping around
them the most appropriate furnishings and the
most suggestive decorative features. It may be
well to add one word of caution, and that is that a
proper balance should be maintained between the
various centres of arrangement in order that no
part of the room may seem neglected and bare.</p>

<p><i>The Danger of Overcrowding.</i>&mdash;Finally, the one
great danger to be avoided in meeting the requirements
of good arrangement is the temptation
to overcrowding. Many otherwise excellently appointed
living rooms suffer from an embarrassment
of riches. Such overcrowded rooms are
worse than an overloaded ship because they cannot
topple over and sink as one might well wish them
to. To secure the right things and just enough
of them, arranged with a proper balance between
utility and beauty, is the true aim. It is as true
to-day as it ever was in the arrangement and beautifying
of the home, and, for that matter, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
everything that concerns every-day life&mdash;just as
true as it was in ancient times when men wrote
those famous inscriptions over the doors of the
temple at Delphi: over one, <span class="smcap">know thyself</span>, and
over the other, <span class="smcap">the golden mean of not too much</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III">III</a><br /><br />
<small>PICTURES</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I now require this of all pictures, that they domesticate me, not that they
dazzle me. Pictures must not be too picturesque. Nothing astonishes men
so much as common sense and plain dealing. All great actions have been
simple, and all great pictures are.&mdash;<i>Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> decoration of a room is generally not
complete without pictures. There is, of
course, great value in good pictures entirely
aside from their decorative effect; and too
great care cannot be exercised in their selection.
But our present purpose is to consider them as
decorative features; for, though a decoration is
not a picture, pictures themselves are properly
regarded as important elements in the general
scheme of decoration. And this is especially true
as regards matting and framing, the distribution of
pictures upon the wall spaces, and the method of
hanging them.</p>

<p><i>Importance of Space Relations.</i>&mdash;A picture mat
and frame are simply elements of finish, and their
function is to give the picture a certain individuality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and yet connect it harmoniously with the
space in which it hangs. In fact, the wall space
is a part of the framing of the picture. The importance
of giving some study to the relations of
all the spaces involved is evident. The mat and
the frame should not be of equal width. Here is a
fine opportunity to secure variety in spacing. No
definite rules can be given; sometimes the one,
sometimes the other should give way. Generally
speaking, tall wall spaces require vertical pictures,
and spaces longer horizontally demand horizontal
pictures. But variation from this rule is possible
and even necessary through the grouping of several
pictures. In grouping, however, there is danger
of being tempted to allow too many pictures. In
the houses of the well-to-do, and even in the homes
of those of moderate means, too many pictures,
rather than too few, are often found. The example
of one New England home, known to the author,
may be mentioned. The house is new, of generous
proportions, and it is the home of an artist.
There are few pictures on the walls, but they are
distributed with rare artistic effect. There are
many good pictures stored in the attic because
there is no suitable space in which to hang them.</p>

<p><i>The Japanese Way.</i>&mdash;The Japanese have taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
us many valuable lessons in art, and in the matter
of the number of pictures to be displayed they have
a very interesting lesson to teach. It is their
practice to hang a single choice picture for a season
in a space where it may be best enjoyed, and then
after a time to replace it with another picture, and
this, perhaps, by another if circumstances permit.
There are many conditions that determine the
selection of the picture to be displayed. It may be
the preference of a guest, or it may be the season
of the year, or, in fact, any occasion that may give
a certain picture special significance. There is,
in this singular custom, a very definite service
which the picture is made to perform, and it is given
an individuality which perhaps has no parallel
in our own practice.</p>

<p><i>Grouping of Small, Simple Pictures.</i>&mdash;If a considerable
number of pictures are grouped together,
it is quite essential that all the pictures of the group
should be of similar character and tone and similarly
framed. It is hardly possible for them to be all
of the same size, nor, indeed, is such agreement
desirable except in so far as is required to give
proper balance to the group. Small pictures in
light frames are, of course, the most desirable
for such grouping, and if possible there should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
an evident reason for the grouping. A series of
photographs of a certain locality, for example,
might form a group of four or five or even more
pictures so that they could be easily seen together
and so more thoroughly enjoyed. A collection
of photographs in passe-partout bindings, especially
if they deal with subjects in any way related,
may form an attractive group. But pictures of
any considerable size or those having decided individuality
are generally not suited to any plan
of grouping. They should appear by themselves,
in frames and other surroundings which accentuate
their peculiar merits.</p>

<p><i>The Kind of Frame.</i>&mdash;The material of the frame,
its colour, and the colour of the mat are determined
by the tone of the picture. Oil paintings easily
support gilt frames and should be hung in good
light. Pictures of light values with white mats
are well finished in narrow gilt frames. Carbon
photographs and other pictures of dull tones, are
appropriately framed in wood of dark or medium
colour, and appear best when hung against a dark
wall. The truth of these statements will hardly
be questioned by any one who has a good sense of
colour harmony. But there are many other elements
that enter into a concrete problem of picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
framing that cannot be brought under general
rules or formulas. It is generally best to depend largely
upon the tests of trial. In framing and hanging pictures,
as in many other things, observation and experience
are the best teachers. Some suggestions
may be found in the following record of two actual
framing problems that were satisfactorily solved.</p>

<h3>FRAMING AN OLD-TIME INTERIOR, DRAWN IN COLOURS</h3>

<p>The conditions which had to be met in this
problem are plainly shown in the framed picture
as it hangs on the wall. The picture itself is a
small one, 8 inches wide and 13 inches long. It
is interesting because of its representation of a
sewing room in one of the high-class homes of
the colonial period. The mistress and her two young
daughters are engaged in sewing and embroidery.
Patterns are displayed upon the wall; the furniture
is appropriate and evidently an example of the
best of the period. All these details are suggestive
of the delightful home life of our grandmothers.</p>

<p>Such a picture needs a mat to give it depth and
to properly emphasize its details; and it requires
a simple, narrow frame. The mat was accordingly
made 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches wide and the frame 1 inch wide.
The tone of the mat selected was a light bluish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
gray, forming a good connecting link between
the bright colours of the picture and the gray of
the wall against which it was to be placed. Since
it was to hang directly over a fine old mahogany
table, it was thought fitting to give the frame a
mahogany finish, connecting the furniture shown
in the picture with that of the room.</p>

<p>The frame was made with mitred corners of
perfectly plain, square-edged birch, which readily
takes a mahogany finish. The stain was first
applied with a brush, rubbed in, and allowed to
dry. A surfacing coat of shellac, coloured to match
the stain, was next put on, allowed to dry, and then
carefully sand-papered, special care being taken to
guard against rounding the edges and corners. A
coat of varnish was next applied, which, after hardening
for one week, was rubbed first with pumice
stone and oil and finally with rotten stone and oil.
A final coat of thin finishing varnish was then put
on, which was lightly rubbed with rotten stone
and water to give the half dull effect required to
match the antique mahogany table.</p>

<h3>FRAMING A CARBON PHOTOGRAPH OF A MASTERPIECE</h3>

<p>The picture is a copy in sepia tones of Murillo's
Saint Anthony, 16 inches in height by 20 inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
horizontally. The frame is made of quartered
oak 3 inches wide, slightly convex but smooth;
and it is well joined with mitred corners. A picture
of this character needs no mat. Indeed, it would
have been the height of presumption to strive
to accentuate a masterpiece of such highly idealistic
meaning and treatment. It must be left to itself
as much as possible. The dimensions of the frame
are therefore determined by the size of the
picture itself.</p>

<p>The picture hangs against a light gray wall in
good light, somewhat apart from other pictures.
It was a happy thought thus to recognize its dignity.
It was given further distinction by finishing
the oak frame so that it should not associate
itself with the other woodwork in the room. Since
the room in which the picture was to hang has a
light ash trim and most of the furniture a mahogany
finish, this requirement was easily met.</p>

<p>But there are many ways of finishing a frame
to avoid too close association with the commonplace
that would have been anything but appropriate
to such a picture as this. A gilt surface,
a silver-gray tone, or a highly polished golden oak
are possible blunders. Nothing should be done
to call attention to the frame of any picture, least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of all to one of such spiritual feeling as this one.
The frame should seem to be a part of the
picture, repeating its prevailing tones with a
richness in keeping with the composition of the
picture itself. The colour should be a rich, dark
brown, but not so dark as to obscure the figure
of the wood. The finish should be dull, but soft
and smooth.</p>

<p>There are several brown stains which, properly
applied, would give the desired effect. For the
colour it was thought best to rely upon Van Dyke
brown, which may be used either with alcohol or
turpentine. It is not desirable to use a water stain
in a case like this because it would raise the grain,
necessitating sand-papering, which should be avoided
as much as possible on picture frames in order to
keep the edges and corners intact. Ammonia
fuming preserves the figure of the wood better
than any other form of staining, but it was thought
that the oak might not take on a tone dark enough
to meet the requirements. It was decided, however,
to try the fuming method and to tone up with a
thin coat of stain if the effect proved to be not
sufficiently dark. The ammonia process resulted
in a rich, soft surface, but in a colour too light. A
thin Van Dyke brown alcohol stain was therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
applied and when dry this was followed by a very
thin coat of shellac&mdash;mostly alcohol&mdash;coloured
to match the stain. This was to fill partially the
grain of the wood. Finally, it was thoroughly coated
with wax finish and well rubbed to restore the soft,
satin-like surface.</p>

<h3>PASSE-PARTOUTS</h3>

<p>Framing pictures in passe-partout binding is
one of the little arts of home decoration, though it
is by no means an unimportant one. It is easy
to learn and it involves small expense in time and
money, but it furnishes a means of preserving
many pictures of real worth in themselves or of
value to their owners because of pleasant associations;
and it is in itself a delightful occupation.
It offers the same chances for artistic effects in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
colour harmony and contrasts, in spacing, and in
the arrangements for hanging that the more difficult
methods of framing do, with the added advantage
that one need not be deterred by the question of
expense from discarding an unsuccessful result
and trying again.</p>

<p><i>Varieties of Binding.</i>&mdash;Passe-partout binding is
made in a great variety of colours. It costs from
ten to twenty cents per roll of twelve yards, according
to colour and quality, and it may be purchased
of dealers in artists' supplies. For general
use the ordinary width of binding&mdash;<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an
inch&mdash;is required; but extra narrow widths are
supplied when it is desired to add a margin of a
contrasting colour. For these margins the gold
and silver narrow bindings are, with certain pictures,
very effective; but white and other light
colours are often used for this purpose.</p>

<p><i>Artistic Colour Effects.</i>&mdash;The choice of the colour
for the principal binding should be controlled mainly
by the tone of the picture, with which, as a general
thing, it should blend. If no mat be used, more
or less of a contrast in colour between the picture
and the binding is permissible; but the most artistic
effects are obtained when mats are used.
These should, of course, be in harmony with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
colour tones and general character of the picture.
It may be a harmony of agreement if there is a
border of light tone between the picture and the
mat, as illustrated in the accompanying drawing.
Without such a border it will be necessary to show
a pleasing contrast of tone. But in almost all cases
when a mat is used the outer binding should repeat
the predominant colour or some other prominent
characteristic of the picture. For example, if it
be a picture of an English hunting scene with
mounted sportsmen in red coats, the mat may be
of a light greenish hue and the binding red. If
it be a landscape photograph in sepia tones, a white
or light coffee-coloured mat with a dark brown
binding is a good combination. A Scotch scene
is appropriately framed in a plaid binding. In
this case it is the subject of the picture rather than
the colour that suggests the binding. But in all
cases opportunity is offered for carefully selecting
the colour combinations, planning the spacing,
and arranging the grouping of pictures of like character.
Thus one of the simplest of decorative
processes presents large artistic possibilities.</p>

<p><i>An Actual Problem.</i>&mdash;The various steps in the
process of framing a picture in passe-partout binding
may perhaps be best understood by giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
an example of it. The actual problem is to frame
a silhouette&mdash;an original drawing in black India
ink on light gray paper, 8 by 10 inches in size,
with the longer dimension vertical.</p>

<p><i>Materials and Tools.</i>&mdash;The materials and tools
required are as follows: A piece of glass the size
of the picture (8 by 10 inches), since no border is
needed; two pieces of thin pasteboard, which may
be cut from an old box cover, the same size as the
glass; a generous yard of black passe-partout binding;
two passe-partout rings, which cost five cents per
dozen; a little photographers' paste; a sharp knife
or a pair of scissors; and an awl or a pointed
nail.</p>

<p><i>The Process.</i>&mdash;With these materials in hand it
will require scarcely more than twenty minutes
to complete the work. The first step is the setting
of the rings. This is accomplished by punching
two small holes in one of the pieces of pasteboard
two inches from the edge chosen for the top and about
one inch from each side. Through these holes the
points of the rings are pushed until the ring is close
to the pasteboard. Bending the points over in
opposite directions fastens the ring firmly. This
is a comparatively large picture. Had it been small&mdash;say
4 by 5 inches or smaller&mdash;only one ring in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the centre, fastened about 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches from the
edge, would have been needed.</p>

<p>The picture is now mounted on the second piece
of pasteboard by fastening it at the upper corners
with a little paste. It is desirable to use as little
paste as possible. The two pieces of pasteboard
are then brought together, care being taken that
the rings are on the outside, and the glass laid over
the picture. These parts are now ready to be bound
together. The sides are bound first. This is done
by cutting two pieces of the binding <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch
longer than the short edges of the picture, wetting
the gummed side and laying it along the edge of
the glass so that it will lap <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch over the
face of the glass. Each end of this binding will
extend <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an inch beyond the glass. The rest
of the binding is now folded over upon the pasteboard
back, taking pains to draw it down close to
the edge of the glass and pasteboard before it is
permanently fastened. The <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an inch that
projects at each end is then folded over the corner
and pressed down as close as possible to the edge
of the glass and pasteboard. The upper and lower
edges are bound in the same way, excepting that the
pieces of binding are first cut the same length as
the edges over which they are to be pasted, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
before they are pasted on, the two corners on the
side to be pasted to the glass are cut off <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an
inch back at an angle of 45 degrees, and the other
corners are also trimmed back to about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an
inch. The accompanying drawing shows more
clearly how these binding strips are trimmed. The
purpose of it is evident; for when the strips are
pasted over the top and bottom edges of the glass,
it is seen that they have been cut to give the appearance
of mitred corners, and that when folded
over the edges upon the back of the pasteboard
no rough edges of binding are left exposed at the
corners.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_095.jpg" width="500" height="161" alt="" />
<div class="caption">How the binding strips are trimmed</div>
</div>

<p>One of the lessons of experience in this work is
that it is well to take great pains in centring
the binding strips accurately before pasting them
on, as they do not stick well if the attempt is made
to correct a mistake by removing the binding and
pasting it on again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
The more elaborate passe-partouts, requiring mats,
borders, and double bindings, are scarcely more difficult
than the simple example just described, though
they will require more time. It is well to begin with
the easier problems. When borders and double
bindings are used the narrow passe-partout strips
are pasted on first, with proper care to cut the
mitres correctly and to centre the strips accurately
before pasting them down upon the glass. The
edges are bound last. This partly covers the
brighter-coloured strips previously pasted along
the edge of the glass, and leaves a narrow line of
colour exposed as a border just inside the
binding.</p>

<h3>HANGING PICTURES</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_097.jpg" width="400" height="317" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A correct method of hanging pictures</div>
</div>

<p><i>How to Hang Pictures.</i>&mdash;If wire be used for hanging
pictures, it should be as small and inconspicuous
as possible. In place of the braided steel wire,
which may be needed for large pictures, a single
brass or copper wire is much to be preferred for
those of lighter weight. In all cases where the wire
shows it should appear as two vertical lines against
the wall and not as a single wire bent over a single
hook in the form of an inverted V, so commonly
seen and so manifestly failing to conform with any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
lines of a room. Levelling the picture may be easily
managed by using only one wire, making it continuous
through the screw eyes on the back of the picture.
These screw eyes should be placed near the
top of the frame&mdash;about one sixth the whole vertical
width of the picture from the top&mdash;so that the picture
may hang nearly flat against the wall. Whenever
possible, however, pictures should be hung without
showing the wire at all. This may be easily managed
without seriously marring the finish of some rooms by
driving two fine finishing nails in the part of the lower
wall which is to come directly behind the top of the
picture, allowing them to project about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
inch and bending them up a little with a pair of
pliers so that the wires will not slip off. Choice,
small pictures may be hung in this way on fine
upholstery tacks. It is often possible, when the
wire must be exposed, to stop it just below the dado
cap and thus avoid showing the wire over the frieze.
Whenever it is necessary, as it often is, to suspend
wires by means of the so-called picture hooks
from a picture moulding or cornice strip placed above
the frieze, some attention should be paid to
the colour of these hooks. Bright metal hooks
showing over a delicately coloured moulding are
in bad taste. Some people prefer to use the
inverted V suspension in order to reduce the number
of these picture hooks. But it is far better to
retain the straight, fine, and nearly invisible
wires and colour the hooks to make them less
conspicuous.</p>

<p>In determining the height of pictures it is only
necessary to remember that they are placed upon the
walls to be enjoyed. While monotony in height
is to be avoided, the average eye level should not
be disregarded. The frontispiece illustrates an
effective placing of a picture in the dining-room of
the model house.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Formerly</span> when the furniture, pictures, and
draperies had been arranged in our rooms, with
perhaps a few pieces of bric-&agrave;-brac, we considered
their decoration quite complete. But we have
learned how much cheerfulness a few simple flowers,
properly arranged, impart to the same rooms;
and so flowers have come to be considered as almost
essential to the complete decoration of the home.</p>

<p><i>A Lesson From the Japanese.</i>&mdash;If we have learned
much from the Japanese in regard to the arrangement
and hanging of pictures, from them we have
learned more about the artistic arrangement of
flowers. They have taught us to value the stem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and leaves of the flower as essential to an artistic
arrangement, that flowers of the same kind should
be grouped together, and that harmony and blending
of colour are necessary to secure the most artistic
effects.</p>

<p><i>Flowers of a Kind Grouped Together.</i>&mdash;We may
have been in the habit of putting several different
kinds of flowers together and of being satisfied with
such a composition; but the Japanese would tell us
that when several different kinds of flowers are combined
in one grouping the full beauty of each is
lost; and after a few experiments we shall come to
see the truth of this. Here is an illustration: At a
summer camp with which I am familiar it was the
daily duty of one of the younger boys to go for the
wild flowers we used for keeping the camp gay. He
often brought home snug little bunches of the flower
of the wild convolvulus and the wild rose, to be
used together. No pleasing arrangement could be
made from such a handful, so he was asked to bring
long pieces of the vine of the convolvulus and
gather branches of the rose, especially those with
the buds. The convolvulus we arranged in a flat
dish at one end of a gray stone mantel, letting the
vine hang over the mantel, and he quickly saw that
it "looked prettier&mdash;more as though it were growing."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
When a few of the stalks of the wild rose
were arranged by themselves in a green glass vase
he pronounced them much "prettier than when
mixed up with other flowers."</p>

<p><i>The Way of the Garden.</i>&mdash;In our gardens we plant
the sunshiny daffodils by themselves, the sweet
peas grow in a mass together, and we have beds of
roses. If we follow the same plan in the arrangement
of our flowers indoors we shall realize their
decorative qualities to the utmost. So we may
consider it a safe rule to follow in arranging flowers,&mdash;to
use only one kind of flower, with its stems and
leaves, arranging them loosely, rather than to have
many in a compact grouping. One single, long-stemmed
rose, with its beautiful foliage, in a tall,
slender glass is more decorative and gives us more
pleasure than a dozen roses stripped of their foliage
and crowded into a small vase.</p>

<p><i>Exceptions.</i>&mdash;While the above rule should be
generally followed, there are exceptional instances
of the perfectly harmonious arrangement of flowers
of two or more kinds together. Among these we
may mention the combining of field daisies and
buttercups, or buttercups with the grasses among
which they grow. So, too, the lacy flower of the
wild carrot may sometimes be effectively combined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
with some other flower. The spikes of the cardinal
flower, for example, are gorgeous in colour, but very
stiff and difficult to arrange; so the addition of a
few sprays of the wild carrot softens the effect and
makes it more pleasing.</p>

<h3>COLOUR ARRANGEMENT</h3>

<p>We have just considered the grouping of flowers
by themselves. There is another element to be
considered before we can have artistic results, and
that is arrangement as to colour.</p>

<p><i>Colour Grouping.</i>&mdash;We may not all be sensitive
to colour ourselves, but in arranging flowers we
should always keep in mind the pleasure that is to be
given others, and so we wish nothing in our colour
grouping that will offend those whose colour sense
is keen. There are three colour schemes that can be
followed with success and satisfaction to all. In
one we group together only flowers of the same
colour, as red roses, pink sweet peas, yellow iris,
not red, pink, and white roses, nor all of the various
colours of sweet pea.</p>

<p>Another arrangement calls for shades and tints
of the same colour. With many flowers it is possible
to get exquisite effects by following this scheme.
For instance, pansies ranging from a pale lavender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to deep purple are lovely arranged in a low basket of
damp moss. Sweet peas have beautiful shades
of pink that can be combined, as well as shades
of red and of lavender. Nasturtiums are never so
effective as when the various shades of yellow, orange
and brown are used together. The garden aster
of to-day is another flower that affords much pleasure
in colour arrangement; for it has lavenders and
purples, a variety of pink tones, beautiful reds, and
perfect white ones.</p>

<p>And the white ones! What shall we do with
these? Three or four pure white asters of the same
variety may be used together; or two or three white
ones may be grouped with a few lavender ones, or
pink ones. White may be combined with any
colour with good results. Nature is a good teacher
here for she gives us both the coloured and the white
in almost every variety of flower. For example there
are crimson cosmos and white cosmos, scarlet geraniums
and white geraniums, blue violets and white
violets, and so on through a great many varieties.</p>

<p><i>Combination of Complementary Colours.</i>&mdash;Another
colour grouping that is sometimes desirable makes
use of the complementary colours. The salpiglossis,
a garden flower that ought to be better known than
it is, gives us examples of these, with its blue and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
orange-yellow flowers that are so effective together.
The iris also has flowers of complementary colours,
yellow and violet blue being common among them.</p>

<h3>THE FLOWER HOLDERS</h3>

<p><i>A Flower Composition as a Picture.</i>&mdash;Having
learned something about the artistic use of colour,
we come to the consideration of the arrangement of
the flowers, and this includes the vase or other receptacle
used for holding them. An artistic flower
composition is a picture; and as the mat and frame
give finish to a picture hanging on the wall, so the
vessel holding flowers should give the required finish
to the flower picture. Like the frame, it should be
simple in design, have graceful lines, and serve only
as a medium to set off the flowers to the best advantage.
There should be as little decoration as
possible, and when jars or vases of colour are used
they must blend or harmonize with the colour
schemes of the flowers placed in them.</p>

<p><i>Receptacles for Flowers.</i>&mdash;It often is a problem
to find the most fitting thing for holding flowers;
but in the reliable Japanese shops one can always
find some simple holders, and there are very good
designs in the clear and in the green glass that are
inexpensive and appropriate. As a rule the less expensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the article the better adapted it is as a suitable
holder for flowers. One need never mourn that
she cannot afford cut glass vases for flowers, as they
and their cheap imitations are among the most
unsuitable of holders.</p>

<p><i>Four Typical Flower Holders.</i>&mdash;Let us suppose our
equipment includes four simple receptacles,&mdash;a
small, clear glass fish globe such as may be had for
twenty-five cents; a clear glass vase, about twelve
inches in height, cylindrical in shape though flaring
a little at the top, costing twenty-five cents; a
large cylindrical Japanese jar of a pale green tint,
eighteen inches in height and costing about one dollar
and a quarter; and a deep green one, about eight
inches in height, which may be bought for sixty or
seventy cents.</p>

<p>The fish globe is very effective when nasturtiums
and their leaves are loosely arranged in it. The
stems show through the water and glass and form
a part of the composition. Short stemmed roses
may be most artistically grouped in it. I have seen
a very charming combination of mignonette and
bachelor's buttons in the same bowl, as well as a
harmonious picture in yellow, composed of the
various shades of California poppies and their
foliage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_106.jpg" width="300" height="282" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A fish globe with daisies</div>
</div>

<p>The tall glass sets off two or three long stemmed
roses: and a few yellow daffodils or the narcissus with
their leaves look equally well in it. Poppies for a day,
in the same vase, have
given pleasure to the
beholder. At Easter
it has joyously borne
a stalk of two perfect
lilies, and in the
autumn tall spikes of
salvia have been
equally at home in it.</p>

<p>Our tall Japanese
jar is suited to larger arrangements, for we need to
remember that in tall or vertical compositions the
vase should be about one third the height of the
whole combination; so this is adapted to holding
branches of apple blossoms or mountain laurel; or, if
one is fortunate enough to find tall lilac bushes, about
three branches from these are effective in it.
Tall-growing golden-rod looks equally well placed
here. It furnishes a modest setting for dahlias and
chrysanthemums, and one of its most decorative compositions
has been two or three branches of pine
bearing their brown cones.</p>

<p>The possibilities of the smaller green jar are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
numerous, and only a few are given as suggestions.
A loose arrangement of jonquils and their leaves,
or of white narcissus, is effective. The shorter
stemmed lilacs, either the
purple ones or the white
ones, may be placed in it.
An arrangement of white
field daisies, and one of
yellow roses, have been found
equally successful. One
soon discovers the harmony
and balance that exist between
the flower and holder.</p>


<h3>THE BACKGROUND</h3>

<img src="images/i_107.jpg" width="250" height="486" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A tall vase with narcissus</div>
</div>

<p><i>Space and Harmonious
Surroundings.</i>&mdash;To obtain
the largest decorative effect
we must have not only
artistic grouping and harmonious setting of flowers,
but space and background, just as are needed for the
hanging of pictures. Many a floral composition
has lost all decorative effect from being placed in
too small a space and surrounded by distracting
objects. A few days ago I stepped into a room on
an errand and forgot my errand in the pleasure I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
derived from seeing some beautiful yellow chrysanthemums,
three or four, I think, in a yellowish
brown jar on a large mahogany table, having for
a background the upturned leaf of the table. It
stood some little distance from anything else, a shaft
of sunlight lay across the whole, and as I looked at
it I thought: Here is all that constitutes a decorative
arrangement of flowers. It was the feature
of the room that held one's attention.</p>

<div class="caption">An arrangement for the tall Japanese jar</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Flowers for the Dining Table.</i>&mdash;If we can have
flowers in but one room in the house, it may be
difficult to decide which one it shall be. Since
it often happens that the dining-room is the only
room where a busy
family comes together
for any length of time,
flowers should certainly
be introduced here that
all may share their
beauty and cheer. Any
arrangement for the
home table should be
moderately low; and
there are many simple
flowers that can be used in this way to advantage.
For instance, one can gather a quantity of the innocence
or common bluet (root and all), to be
found in any field in the spring, and put them in a
shallow glass dish. Simple and effective decoration
for the table is the result. Flowers with any
degree of fragrance should never be used in the
dining-room. The fragrance of some flowers is
offensive to many people, and when combined with
the odour of food doubly so.</p>

<div class="caption">An arrangement of roses in a small jar</div>
</div>

<p>At a luncheon served by the girls in the model<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
house the floral decoration for the table was a half
dozen single, yellow jonquils with their foliage,
placed in a creamy brown vase made by one of the
girls. Their dishes being in white with a gold edge
and the walls and furniture in browns, nothing could
have been more harmonious than these few simple
flowers.</p>

<p><i>Expensive Flowers not Necessary.</i>&mdash;It is evident
that for floral decoration neither expensive nor
lavish displays are necessary, that simplicity is
the thing to strive for, and that a few sprays of
wild flowers in their season are more truly artistic
than many expensive hot-house flowers. In this
country we do not, as the Japanese do, make a
festival in honour of certain flowers; but if we
rightly appreciate and utilize the flowers of each
season, we may give a touch of festivity to the life
of every day.</p>

<p>In the early spring nothing can be more appropriate
than an arrangement of pussy willows or
branches of the alder with its tassels, while the red
maple when in flower gives a touch of colour that
will brighten any room. A clump of blood root
in a small jardiniere is as decorative as the expensive
plants one may see in the home of some friend.
The flowers of the field and the garden offer so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
possibilities for decorative results that no one's home
need lack the cheery touch which they can give.</p>

<p>There is a personal element in flowers such as
is not found in any other means of decoration,
not even in pictures, with the single exception of
good portraits. They seem to speak to us. We can
almost believe that they feel an interest in all that
we have said about them. If they really could know,
would they not approve the principles that we have
laid down? We may fancy that they <i>would</i> approve
and that, if they could really speak and we would
listen, they would tell us so in some such language
as the following:</p>

<h3>WHAT THE FLOWERS SAY ABOUT IT</h3>

<p>Don't mix us; we are exclusive and prefer our
own kind.</p>

<p>Don't make a confusion of colour with us.</p>

<p>Don't arrange us in snug, solid masses.</p>

<p>Don't neglect to use our stems and foliage as a
part of the decoration.</p>

<p>Don't tie us with ribbons, nor put paper-lace frills
around us.</p>

<p>Don't crowd us in with an assortment of household
goods; we need space and a background.</p>

<p>Don't arrange us in tall, stiff forms for the dining
table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Do</i> love us and use us in the home as much
as possible. This is well for you. By so doing
not only will your love of us increase, but your
artistic perception of the fitness of things will
constantly enlarge. For truly has it been said,
"The poorest woman in the world, if she has faith
in beauty, will always be able to fill her home with
light; she can always place there some flowers."</p>

<small>DECORATIVE FABRICS</small></h2>

<h3>PORTI&Egrave;RES, WINDOW DRAPERIES, CUSHION COVERS,
TABLE MATS</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The very need of ornament arises out of a certain innate discontent with
plain, smooth surface&mdash;<i>Lewis F. Day</i></p></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">No kind</span> of decorative art offers greater
possibilities for touching the right&mdash;or the
wrong&mdash;chord than that which makes use
of fabrics. Porti&egrave;res, curtains, cushion covers, table
runners and mats, lamp shades, and many other furnishings,
in which fabrics are involved, present problems
that quickly engage the interest of the amateur
decorator who wishes to avoid the commonplace and,
when well worked out, add greatly to the attractiveness
of artistic surroundings. And every house becomes
a studio for problems peculiar to itself, when
the possibilities of development in this direction are
realized. Here, as everywhere else, decorative art
is secondary to architectural design and must never
fail to acknowledge its dependence. Its glory is to
follow. To attempt to lead means miserable failure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Example of the Model House.</i>&mdash;The wide doorways
connecting the hall, the living room, and dining-room
of our model house made doors undesirable
and portieres necessary to assist in marking the division
between the rooms and to soften the lines of the
wood finish. They were made to harmonize with
the colour scheme but were darker and richer in
tone. The multiple windows, with the absence of
direct sunshine, suggested the light style of drapery;
and the preference given to straight-lined, substantial
furniture, made in the school shops, led as
a natural consequence to cushions and coverings
of leather or coarse fabric, in order to bear out the
idea of simplicity, directness, and durability in
craftsmanship. Velvets and satins would have
been out of place.</p>

<p><i>Utility to be Regarded.</i>&mdash;The highly decorative
function of such accessories makes it doubly necessary
to exercise care in selecting materials, designing
the ornamental features, and properly placing
the completed article, in order that the requirements
of use be not subordinated to the demands of art.
It must never be forgotten that utility is the basis
of all true decoration. Portieres were originally
a substitute for doors&mdash;a means of closing an
opening between rooms. It must be possible always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
for them easily to serve this purpose. Hence
loops or rings, which slide easily over a pole, should
be used. Porti&egrave;res may properly be made of heavy
cloth and they may have a lining harmonizing or
in pleasing contrast with the tone of the principal
fabric. They should always be at least opaque.
Window draperies, on the other hand, are not a
substitute for shades or curtains. They should not
shut out the light but soften it. They should,
therefore, be made of light, washable, and durable
material, and be hung so that they can be easily
taken down for cleaning. The simplest style of
hanging, by means of a brass rod and plain brackets,
is the best. Since there is no need of frequently
sliding them over the rod, it is well to hang them
by means of a hem, stitched two or three inches from
the top of the drapery, through which the rod may
be easily pushed. Cushion covers and table runners,
made of durable material and decorated with colours
that are washable, are manifestly more serviceable
than those that look fresh only when new, and
hence are more in keeping with the idea of
sincerity in household decoration. There is
necessity for honesty in decoration as well as in
plumbing if it is to meet the tests with equal success.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;To carry out the problem as illustrated,
it is necessary, first of all, to make the design.
Geometry, nature, and the imagination are satisfactory
sources upon which to draw for the motif.
If the inventive faculty is quite undeveloped, one
should study for suggestions the figures in Oriental
rugs, photographs of early Eastern art, and the
fine old tapestries in museum collections. Some
good geometrical designs, like that used on the
pillow cover illustrated on <a href="#Page_104">page 104</a>, were made
by school-girls after drawing many figures found in
rugs; and interesting bird patterns, after studying
numerous reproductions of Coptic designs. In
no case was the block pattern in the least like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
designs studied. They served only as ideas to start
with and led to the production of truly original
work. It is essential to keep a few simple principles
in mind in working out the design: (1) Both the dark
and light shades in the patterns
should be varied in
size and form to avoid a
monotonous result and should
be as beautiful in proportion
as possible. (2) There should
be a centre of interest, one
part of the design dominant&mdash;more
attractive than any
other. (3) The design must be a unit&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
the parts must hold together. All feeling of unity
is lost if the parts of the design call attention to
themselves to the exclusion of the whole.</p>

<img src="images/i_120.jpg" width="200" height="206" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Block used in printing the
peacock design</div>
</div>

<p><i>Preliminary Sketches and the Drawing.</i>&mdash;It will be
found desirable to make many preliminary sketches
in charcoal or soft pencil, rubbing in a part of each
sketch with a tone in order to secure immediately
the dark and light effect. These should be compared,
keeping clearly in mind the principles stated
above. When one possessing the right qualifications
has been found, the next step is to draw on a
fresh piece of paper an accurate 3-inch square and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
copy upon it the satisfactory design in pencil outline.
This should be done very carefully, that the spirit of
the original charcoal sketch may not be lost. When
the drawing is completed it must be put into shape
to be transferred to the block. To do this we fasten
a piece of rice-paper over the drawing and trace
with very light pencil lines, filling in the dark spaces
with black ink, using a brush. This brush work
may be done directly without the pencil line if the
drawing underneath shows very plainly through the
paper. When the ink has thoroughly dried, the design
may be cut out on the edge of the 3-inch square.</p>

<div class="caption">Bird pattern</div>
</div>

<p><i>Laying the Pattern and Cutting the Block.</i>&mdash;A block<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
3 &times; 3 &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inches will now be required. This
should be procured and sand-papered. One face
of it should then be covered with a coating of library
paste, the pattern laid upon it, and rubbed down
smooth. If the design is symmetrical it should be
pasted on the block, ink side up, but otherwise with
the ink side down, or the design will be reversed upon
the cloth. When the paste gets quite dry one may
then fasten the block in the vise and, holding the
blade of the knife at a slight angle and always
away from the dark spots, proceed to cut the design
along the outlines. These must be kept very smooth
and sharp. All of the white shapes should be cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
out, leaving the black ones in relief. Usually
an eighth of an inch will be deep enough for the background,
but it will be found after practise in printing
that the larger spaces should be cut deeper and
that, when the edges or corners of
the block form a part of the background
instead of the dark pattern,
they also need a deeper cut. The
paper that still adheres to the face of
the block may now be removed by
rubbing it upon a sheet of sand-paper
laid upon something hard and smooth like glass in
order that the block may have an absolutely

<p><i>The Padded Board.</i>&mdash;All block printing should be
done upon a padded board. A very convenient
one can be made by laying upon a bread board three
or four sheets of blotting paper, and tacking over
these several thicknesses of cheese cloth. In place
of these an ironing board may be used.</p>

<p><i>Material Required.</i>&mdash;It is essential to select for
the runner a piece of crash of fine texture and even
weave. This is sold under the name of Russian
crash and is from 15 to 16 inches wide but varies
considerably in quality. It is very difficult to
print well upon the coarser grades.</p>

<div class="caption">Blocks used in printing this design</div>
</div>

<p><i>Trying the Colours.</i>&mdash;After deciding upon a colour
which will harmonize with the general colour scheme
of the room in which the table runner is to be used,
it is in order to mix the paint and try the block upon
a small piece of crash. To prepare the paint, squeeze
a small quantity of the true colours chosen upon a
sheet of glass and blend thoroughly with the palette
knife, thinning with turpentine to the consistency
of cream. It is seldom that a colour right from
the tube will prove a pleasing one to use. Other
colours mixed with it will change its hue and intensity;
black or white will alter the value. Tie a little
cotton batting up in a small square of cheese cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
or old handkerchief linen, being careful to remove
from the raw edges all ravellings that might drop
into the paint. Spread out quite thin upon the
glass a small portion of the prepared paint and press
the pad into it a number of times until it has absorbed
all it will. Now charge the block by lightly
pounding its surface with the pad. Press the block
upon the cloth evenly. Only by repeated experiment
will it be possible to determine just the right
quantity of paint to mix, its brilliancy of tone, its
consistency, how heavily to charge the block, etc.
A good print shows the texture of the cloth through
it, is even in tone, and has clear-cut edges. If
the print looks like a painted spot, or if, when quite
dry, you find it has stiffened the cloth, the paint
used was too thick or else the block was too heavily
charged. Different materials require different
treatment. For a thin silk the block should be
very lightly charged and lightly though evenly
pressed upon the material. In printing upon crash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
it is necessary to press the block very firmly upon
the material; and frequently, to insure getting a
sufficiently strong impression, it is advisable to
tap the block lightly with a hammer or wooden
mallet. If one has a steady hand, the block can
easily be lifted at one side to determine just where
the extra pressure is needed. The block should be
thoroughly rubbed with old cloth after each impression
is made and occasionally sand-papered
to remove any paint that may adhere to it. The
first print made after sand-papering the block is
liable to be a little less distinct than the others and
should therefore be made upon an extra piece of the
material.</p>

<p><i>Centring the Work.</i>&mdash;A good way to plan the placing
of the panel design is to run a basting thread
across the crash between two of the woven threads.
Mark the centre of the runner upon this thread,
and, using these guides, print the design, beginning
with one of the central units.</p>

<p><i>Additional Features.</i>&mdash;Considerable charm can be
added to the pattern by filling some of the spaces
with a simple darning or running stitch in some
bright colour. The embroidery thread used should
be rather fine. It is well to finish the ends of the
runner by button-holing with ravellings of the crash.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Tiny dots of some colour used in the panel may be
embroidered at intervals just above the button-holed
edge.</p>

<p><i>Colours.</i>&mdash;The following list of oil colours will be
found practical: ivory black, flake white, burnt
sienna, light red, crimson lake, chrome yellow,
chrome green, permanent blue.</p>

<p><i>Materials.</i>&mdash;Linen, cotton, soisette, all or part silk
pongee, cr&ecirc;pe de chine, cheese cloth, and unbleached
muslin are excellent materials for block printing.
Beautiful background tones can be obtained by
dyeing the two latter with easy dyes.</p>

<p>In place of the gum wood for the block, basswood,
maple, or holly may be used. It is possible to get
along without a vise by fastening the block between
two cleats nailed to an old table or heavy board.
Success is sometimes achieved in cutting blocks
while simply held in the hand.</p>

<p><i>Laundering.</i>&mdash;If the material used for the foundation
is washable, block printed articles can be
satisfactorily and easily laundered in soapy, lukewarm
water. The colours are not injured in the
least. A liquid called stencil mordant is sometimes
used in place of turpentine, insuring still greater
permanency of colour.</p>

<p><i>Other Applications of Block Printing.</i>&mdash;Other articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
suitable for decoration by block printing are
curtains, pillow covers, table covers, cushion covers,
bureau scarfs, Portieres, table mats, bags of many
sorts, etc. Printing may also be used to ornament
articles for personal use, such as aprons and scarfs.</p>


<h3>STENCILLING</h3>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;Suggestions as to the method of
procedure in making a design have been already
given in the section on block printing. The principles
of design to be considered are outlined there
also. In working out this problem, however, several
new things come up for explanation: (1) The
difference between a design to be stenciled and one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to be printed by means of a wood block; (2) the
method of joining units to form a border; (3) the
method of turning a corner in a border design.</p>

<div class="caption">Window Draperies With Stenciled Border. Designed and
Executed by a School Girl</div>
<div class="capl"> [Plate IV]</div>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Stencil Bands.</i>&mdash;By studying the illustrations
accompanying this section and by experimenting
with the charcoal or soft pencil, it will be seen that
in a stencil design the dark spots which stand for the
color in the finished work are completely separated
from one another by bands of varying widths.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_131.jpg" width="300" height="297" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A stencilled pattern&mdash;portion of pillow cover</div>
</div>

<p>These bands, or bridges, as they are called, serve
to hold the stencil together and are connected
throughout the design. Though they may be as
wide as one desires, it is seldom wise to make them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
much narrower than one eighth of an inch, as they
are easily broken; and, unless carefully pinned down
when stencilling, the paint is liable to run under
them and ruin the work. In a block print design
no connection of the light or separation of the dark
parts has to be considered. In the illustration of
the stencil observe that the dark and light are reversed
as compared with the stencilled pattern&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
the dark represents the stencil paper, the light
the openings through which the paint is applied.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_132.jpg" width="300" height="301" alt="" />
<div class="caption">The stencil for this pattern</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Complete Unit.</i>&mdash;It will be readily understood
that a border may be made up by repetition of
one unit which is a complete thing in itself. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
unit in such a case may be made very long and
narrow, so that in repeating it along the vertical
edge of a curtain it produces a narrow band, while
along the horizontal edge the band is broad. A
border worked out in this way, with perfectly
straight and practically continuous margins, is very
structural in character, emphasizing, as it does,
the vertical and horizontal edges of the drapery.
The effect is strong and dignified. The corner in
this kind of border presents no difficulty.</p>

<p><i>The Subordinate Unit.</i>&mdash;By studying the illustration
in <a href="#PLIV">Plate IV</a> it will be seen that the unit of the
border in this case is not complete in itself, but that
the very conventional flower and stem composing
it are joined to the next unit by what might be called
a subordinate unit, composed, in this case, of a
leaf form. The units are so closely spaced that a
structural effect is fairly well obtained&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, the
upper and lower edges of the border are nearly
straight, giving a feeling of restfulness to the design
that never accompanies one with broken or wavy
edges.</p>

<p><i>Designing the Corner.</i>&mdash;Having planned a design
for the straight running border of the curtains, take
a reflector and experiment with the corner. The
reflector can easily be made by cutting from an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
discarded looking-glass a small rectangular piece,
3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> by 6 inches being a convenient size. The edges
should be very straight and the corners square.
Hold the reflector at various points along the border
and always at an angle of 45 degrees. Study these
possible corners which will be reflected in the glass,
and when one sufficiently strong and interesting
is found draw a light line along the edge of the
reflector. This line, of course, exactly bisects the
corner of the border to be made. Avoid making a
border of this kind too deep or, when turned for
the vertical edges, it will form a very broad and
heavy band.</p>

<p><i>The Outline Drawing.</i>&mdash;The dark and light design
having thus been worked out in charcoal, the next
thing to do is to make a very careful pencil-outline
drawing of the same. It is well to draw the corner
and one unit free-hand and trace the rest. To do
the tracing, pin a piece of very thin paper over the
finished part, and trace with a well sharpened and
fairly soft pencil. Turn the tracing paper upside
down, fitting a part of the tracing to the drawing
underneath. After tacking it down, trace the remainder,
using a firm, even pressure and being careful
exactly to follow the line. Strengthen the part of
the pattern thus transferred by going over it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
a sharp, hard point, and continue as before until you
have a border of which both the vertical and horizontal
sections are from 9 to 12 inches long.</p>

<p><i>Transfer to Stencil Paper.</i>&mdash;Now, take a piece of
stencil paper and square up one corner. Fasten
the pencil drawing securely to the stencil paper
along one edge, slip a piece of carbon paper between
the two, and trace the design.</p>

<p><i>Cutting the Stencil.</i>&mdash;Before cutting the stencil
for the curtain a beginner should do a little practising
upon an extra piece of the paper. Trace a portion
of the design upon this piece, lay it upon a sheet of
glass or very hard wood, and with a sharp penknife
cut along the outline of the pattern. The knife
should be held at a slight angle and the cut made
completely through the paper. The pieces of stencil
paper should never be pulled out but will fall out
without aid when the cutting is completed. After
a little practice it will be found a simple matter to
cut the design with perfectly smooth edges.</p>

<p><i>Suitable Materials for Stencilling.</i>&mdash;For the curtains
fine cheese cloth or batiste will be found excellent.
Even unbleached muslin will make attractive curtains
where expense must be carefully considered.
Unless the woodwork of the room is white, the pure
white materials will be found less pleasing than those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
that are quite creamy in tone. Scrim in a charming,
grayish tan colour is obtainable, and, if of good, soft
quality, makes most satisfactory curtains. It is
not advisable to hemstitch this material before
stencilling as in case of accident or failure so much
work is lost; but the hems should be carefully
planned and basted, those along the inner edges of
the curtains being narrower than the bottom hems.</p>

<p><i>The Colours.</i>&mdash;The color scheme of the room should
be carefully considered in deciding upon the colour
or colours to be used in stencilling. If two colours
are chosen, they should be of the same value&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
the two colours should form equally dark spots
in order that the pattern of the border may appear
in the same dark and light as the original charcoal
sketch.</p>

<p><i>Pinning the Stencil.</i>&mdash;When ready for the actual
process of stencilling, lay a large sheet of blotting
paper upon a board and over this place the corner
of the curtain. Pin the stencil securely to the
curtain so that the edge of the border when printed
shall be about half an inch from the hem and the
edges of both shall be absolutely parallel. Use as
few pins as possible but enough to keep the stencil
close to the cloth.</p>

<p><i>Testing the Paint.</i>&mdash;Having mixed the oil paint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
with turpentine or stencil mordant, using an old cup
or glass for each colour, practise stencilling upon a
small piece of cloth. Put blotting-paper under the
cloth and pin the stencil down with great care.
Use short, stiff bristle brushes for the stencilling,
one for each colour. Remove almost all the paint
from the brush by pressing it upon blotting-paper.
When it leaves scarcely a mark, proceed to stencil
the pattern by pounding the brush upon the exposed
portions of the cloth, working close to the
edge of each spot. If, upon removing the stencil,
the edges are blurred, the paint was too thin or
the stencil not carefully pinned down. If, on the
other hand, the coloured spots look thick and painty,
so that upon drying, the cloth is found stiffened in
these places, you may be sure that the paint
used was too thick or that the brush was too wet.
The secret of good stencilling is to use the paint as
thin and the brush as dry as possible. Hold the
stencilled sample up to the window and see whether,
when the light shines through it, the colour appears
right.</p>

<p><i>The Real Process.</i>&mdash;When confident that the
process is understood and that the colour is satisfactory,
proceed to stencil the corner of the curtain.
Always have at hand a bottle of turpentine and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
clean piece of cloth to use in case of accident.
When removing the pins from the stencil wipe each
one carefully. Clean the stencil, too, handling it
with care that none of the slender bridges may be
broken. Replace the stencil, fitting a section of
it to the finished work. Put the pins in the holes
already made, otherwise the paint will get into
them and disfigure the work. Continue the stencilling,
a section at a time, until the border is completed.
Do not fold the curtains until the stencilling
is thoroughly dry. If the threads of the material
can be easily pulled, a hemstitched edge will make
the best finish; but careful hand hemming will look
well upon material like fine batiste.</p>

<p><i>The Valance.</i>&mdash;The curtains should hang in vertical
folds from the top of the window to a point slightly
below the window sill. They should be drawn back
at each side of the window and the space between at
the top filled by a valance about a foot deep, perhaps
deeper if the window is very high. This valance
should have the border stencilled upon it and should
be tacked just underneath the edge of the curtains.
Sometimes, as in the illustration in <a href="#PLIV">Plate IV</a>, a
valance running across the entire width of the
window is used. In this case it is run upon an extra
rod in front of the one from which the curtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
hangs. Double rods for this purpose can be
bought.</p>

<p><i>Other Possible Problems.</i>&mdash;As stencilling can be
employed in practically the same place and upon
the same materials as block printing, it is only
necessary to refer to the lists given at the end of
that section of this chapter for suggestions as to
further possibilities in the way of home decoration
by stencilling.</p>


<h3>EMBROIDERY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Problem</span>: <i>Table Mat</i>.&mdash;As in the preceding problems,
the first thing to do is to plan the design roughly
in charcoal or soft pencil in order to get the dark and
light relations and the best proportions possible.
If convenient, the mat should be made for use with
some special lamp or vase. By measuring the base
of this object it is easy to determine the size of the
plain central space, which may be either circular
or square in shape. The forms in the decorated
part may be made of various shapes, but it is well
to keep them very simple in outline. Straight lines
alone may be employed, as in the mats illustrated
in <a href="#PLV">Plate V</a>, or a combination of straight and curved
lines, as in the one shown in <a href="#PLIII">Plate III</a>. After working
out the design very accurately with a hard pencil,
the next thing in order is to transfer it to a piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
coarse Russian crash or heavy linen by means of
carbon paper, taking great care to get the straight
edges of the design even with the threads of the
crash.</p>

<p><i>Desirable Combinations of Colour and Stitches.</i>&mdash;The
simple running or darning stitch should be employed
in embroidering the pattern. Two or more colours
may be used. Darning in dull green and outlining
with black in the same stitch makes a very attractive
mat. Other good combinations are green and
white, blue and white, blue and green, soft dull
blue, and pinkish orange. This by no means exhausts
the pleasing contrasts that may be found.
The brighter colour should always be employed in
the smaller quantities. The mat illustrated in
<a href="#PLV">Plate V</a> was embroidered in dull green and red
mercerized cotton. After the darning was completed
it was found that the red used in the small
circles alone was too conspicuous, although it was
very dull in tone. This defect was completely
remedied and a perfect unity given to the design
by outlining the forms in a couching stitch,
using both colours. This was done by laying
a green thread along the edge of each spot
and taking a stitch of red over it at equal
intervals.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<div class="capl">[Plate V]</div>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>After the embroidered pattern is done one may
finish the mat with fine, close hemstitching or by
button-holing the edge with ravellings of the crash.
The latter method is usually more pleasing. The
simple darning stitch can also be used to make
very attractive borders for table runners, sofa
pillows, decorations for work bags, as illustrated
in <a href="#PLV">Plate V</a>, besides being used to enrich a
great variety of block printed or stencilled articles.</p>

<p><i>The Satin Stitch.</i>&mdash;Another effective and easy
embroidery stitch to be used in decorating articles
for the home is the over-and-over or satin stitch.
When planning to use this stitch upon coarse linen
in which the threads can be easily counted, transfer
the design, after having carefully drawn it in pencil
outline, to paper marked off into little squares.
This can be bought where kindergarten supplies
are sold. Redraw the outline of the design, following
exactly the lines on the paper, and at the
same time keep as close as possible to the original
form. Let a certain number of threads of linen
represent a square of the design and copy the pattern
in the satin stitch or even the cross stitch if
preferred. No transferring of the pattern to the
cloth is necessary.</p>

<p>A pattern worked out on cross section paper in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
this way can also be crocheted, as illustrated in
<a href="#PLV">Plate V</a>, and set into linen or some of its many
imitations to decorate numberless articles for home
or personal adornment. This crocheted work, if
evenly done in fine thread, is quite suggestive of
the Italian filet lace.</p>

</div></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> considering the dress of the person as related
to home decoration one is not so far afield
as one may seem to be at first thought. It is
true that dress has a variety of functions to perform
that have no connection with the subject of decoration;
and yet there is much that is common to both.
Well-dressed people of whatever age or sex, in the
design and general make-up of their costumes, must
observe the same laws that govern design wherever it
is applied, as an expression of the artistic sense in
the affairs of every-day life. Beauty of line and
proportion, harmony of colour, adaptation to use
and to a great variety of special conditions, simplicity,
symmetry, restraint, are all involved in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
personal attire, as they are in the decoration of a
room; and in most cases success or failure in one
field has its counterpart in the other. Have we
not often remarked of a house or of a room that
it looks "just like her" or perhaps "just like him";
and do not attractive costumes give pleasure to
others than those who wear them for the same
reasons that properly decorated and well-arranged
rooms afford similar enjoyment to those who live
in them?</p>

<p><i>Art and the Fashions.</i>&mdash;In discussing the parallel
between art in clothing and the more stable art
of home decoration it must be admitted, of course,
that style in dress introduces some embarrassing
questions; for the styles, especially for women, suffer
wonderful changes with every season. And yet
people of artistic feeling and good taste, succeed
in maintaining a fair degree of harmony between
the changing demands of fashion and the established
principles of art as applied in dress.</p>

<p><i>How to Be Well Dressed.</i>&mdash;The well-dressed woman
knows how to select her clothes and how to wear
them. She must study her own figure and know
her defects as well as her good points. With this
knowledge she can learn to subdue the one and bring
out the other. She should have a clear conception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of the ideal figure and strive to adapt herself to it.
To acquire this training the principles of the art
of decoration must be understood and applied.
She should never wear a garment of a certain style
simply because it is the fashion, but strive to make
it conform to her individual type.</p>

<p><i>Good Lines.</i>&mdash;Decorative design in dress must
follow the construction lines of the figure and not
destroy them. These are the much discussed good
lines of which we hear and read so much. Horizontal
lines break the figure and increase the breadth,
while vertical lines give the appearance of height.
It is the simple lines, conforming to and following
the lines of the ideal figure, which are the best. The
taste of most women leads them to desire simple
clothes; but through ignorance or inexperience
many of these women fail to achieve that aim. A
stout woman with a round back is sometimes seen
wearing a dress with lapels or ruffles over the
shoulders. This only serves to accentuate her defect.</p>

<p><i>Unity and Harmony.</i>&mdash;In all forms of decoration
harmony is essential&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, all the parts that are
to be combined must agree with one another and
with their surroundings. To secure this in dress
is to give unity to the entire costume. A dress
hat with plumes should not be worn with a tailored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
suit in the morning; and yet we often see such a
combination. Here the lack of harmony is between
the parts of the costume; but the entire costume
must be suited to the peculiarities of figure. There
are women who never look well in the straight lines
of a tailored suit: the severity is not becoming to
them. They must tone down the effects of the lines
by ruchings, ruffles, a soft stock, or some such
softening elements of dress. Others do not look
well in fluffy things. Each must know what is
becoming and dress accordingly.</p>

<p><i>Importance of Colours.</i>&mdash;Every season we hear that
certain colours are to be worn. Many women will
choose a colour because they like it without considering
whether it is suitable for them to wear. A little
attention to a few well-known facts will help them
to avoid failures of this kind. It is generally recognized
that light colours seem to increase the size.
Striped materials should not be worn by the stout
women unless the stripes are very indistinct. Dots
are also very dangerous for her; but she may choose
a pattern with pin-point dots scattered over the
surface at some distance from each other. She is
always safe in a plain, dark colour.</p>

<p><i>Colour and Complexion.</i>&mdash;In deciding on a becoming
colour one must take into account the colour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the hair and eyes and the tone of the complexion.
It has been thought that young girls can wear clear,
light shades and that older women should keep to
dark, quiet colours; yet there are older women who
wear pale gray, mauve, and lavender charmingly
and many young girls who cannot wear blue or
pink. It is quite impossible to make accurate colour
rules, because it would be hard to find two complexions
that require exactly the same colour setting.
It is well, however, to study combinations of different
colours with the idea of finding the right
colour, to use in any costume, the amount of each,
and the best arrangement to give a proper
balance.</p>

<p><i>Proportion.</i>&mdash;The importance of the principle
of proportion is often overlooked, but beauty of
dress is never possible if it be neglected. A
well-dressed woman, in selecting her hat, must
have given consideration to the relation of the size
and shape of the head to the lines of the entire figure.
Strictly speaking, a hat is a covering for the head,
and it should seem to belong to the head, to protect
it, and, through harmony of colour and proportion
of line and mass, to improve the appearance of the
whole costume. The artist, when drawing a figure,
uses the head as the unit of measure. Therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in choosing a hat one should select a style that is
in good proportion to the size of the head and to the
height of the figure. If the mass of the head is
increased disproportionately by too large a hat,
the entire figure is apparently shortened and the
natural proportions destroyed. One often wonders
why photographs of people with hats on look so
old-fashioned and sometimes so ridiculous. It is
because the hat is not in good proportion. The
Gainsborough and Reynolds ladies with hats never
look queer. Their hats bear the right relation to
the head and the figure.</p>

<p><i>Appropriateness.</i>&mdash;The general proportions of a
hat or a gown may be good, but the addition of the
decoration may destroy all the good effect obtained
by securing the right relation of line and mass. The
aim of all decoration should be to harmonize and
strengthen the whole. Beauty of dress, therefore,
depends upon simplicity and appropriateness of
the material used as well as upon the form and
arrangement of the material. Wherever ornament
is used it must fulfil the condition of fitness to place;
otherwise it is not really decorative. In trimming
a hat, the one who is to wear it should take her seat
before a mirror, and place the hat comfortably upon
her head; then with the aid of a hand glass she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
should try the trimming in different positions until
the best effect is obtained.</p>

<p>The designs in trimming should be appropriate
to the garment. The size of the design and the kind
of form used should be considered. Simple forms are
the best for all decorative art work. In fact, there
is great advantage in plain materials. They always
work to greater economy than stripes or plaids.</p>

<p><i>Influence of Occupation.</i>&mdash;The well-dressed woman
should realize how great is the influence of occasion
and occupation. Some gowns were intended only
for afternoon wear in the house; but we often see
them worn on the street cars or for shopping. I
have always approved of the rule in many shops
which requires the clerks to wear plain black gowns.
Formerly it was the old finery which was used for
every-day wear. Now the business woman to
be successful has to exercise more thought upon her
clothes than the woman at home. Her clothes have
harder wear and must be appropriate for her work.</p>

<p>The dress of school-girls and children must not
be overlooked. It should be as simple as possible
and above all else it should be comfortable. It
should never bind or pinch; indeed, the clothing
should not interfere with any function of the body.
But we often see children dressed with much lace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
with many ruffles, and even with jewellery; and
we have seen school girls wearing net waists,
plumed hats, and high-heeled shoes. What an
infraction is this of the principle of appropriateness
in dress!</p>

<p>It is only by labour that thought can be made healthy, and only by thought

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> chief purpose of this chapter is to outline
the most important general facts upon
which good furniture making is based and
to give specific directions for working out a number
of typical problems, following designs which have
been proved in completed articles made, for the
most part, by school-boys and tested by use. No
attempt is made to give this great subject complete
and systematic treatment; for this would involve
many problems in constructive design and a corresponding

specifications for the selection and preparation of
materials and for the work of construction&mdash;a
subject so extensive that it would easily overrun
the limits of a single chapter. The aim is rather
to select a few of the most suggestive lessons of
experience in constructive work with special reference
to our main subject of household decoration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>It is taken for granted that the interested reader is
familiar with the use of the common hand tools
for woodworking or that he can, with some assistance,
perhaps, easily command their use. It is
not thought necessary, therefore, to describe in
detail the proper method of using tools, but rather
to offer practical suggestions on the selection,
preparation and constructive use of woodworking
materials and, in the series of problems which
follow, to give some helpful hints on the way woodworking
tools should be used. It is also assumed
that in most cases the very great advantage of
woodworking machinery may be utilized, especially
in preparing the materials and bringing them
within easy reach of the hand-tool processes. The
true art-craft spirit, which always honours handwork
as the supreme method, may not hesitate to
command the services of machines so long as it
does not become slavishly dependent upon them.</p>


<h3>SELECTION AND PREPARATION OF STOCK</h3>

<p>The first thing that should claim the attention
of the artistic woodworker is the selection and preparation
of his materials, commonly known as the
stock. The sculptor selects his marbles with the
greatest care. So should the cabinet-maker make
sure that his woods are taken from the right parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of selected timber and that they are properly
sawed and well seasoned. The importance of this
cannot be overestimated. Hard wood boards, cut
from the sides of a tree, will in drying, invariably
curve across their grain. It is only those that
are cut from the centre to the outside of the tree
that may be depended upon to remain approximately
true; for, after this cutting, the grain runs directly
through the thickness of the board, or nearly so.
Boards taken from timber in this way are said to
be "quarter sawed"; those cut by sawing through
the logs from side to side, as is always done with
soft woods and often with hard woods, are said to
be "plain sawed." This is illustrated in the accompanying
drawings.</p>

<p><i>Quartered Oak.</i>&mdash;In the case
of oak, the quarter sawing not
only maintains a flat surface
but greatly improves the appearance
of the stock when finished.
The popularity of
quartered oak for furniture
may therefore be said to be
well founded, for it is the sincerest of woods. It
is as good as it looks.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_155.jpg" width="200" height="207" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Quarter sawed log</div>
</div>

<p>Quarter sawing, however, is very largely confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to oak because the appearance of the grain and
the strength of most woods is far from being improved
by this method of cutting. Thus ash and
gum wood and all the softer woods sometimes used
in furniture making are plain sawed. We shall,
therefore, generally find stock from these woods
curved and twisted badly so
that it will be necessary, in
selecting material for large
surfaces such as table tops, to
pick out the straight parts for
these surfaces and save the
remainder to be cut into the
smaller pieces which will always
be needed. These pieces can be easily planed
without much loss of thickness.</p>

<div class="caption">End of plain sawed board</div>
</div>


<p><i>Kiln-dried Lumber.</i>&mdash;This bending and twisting
of the boards does not take place as soon as they
are sawed out of the log, but gradually during the
process of seasoning; and, unless the lumber is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
kiln-dried, the more gradual the seasoning the less
the bending. Lumber is kiln-dried by stacking it,
with air spaces left between the boards, in steam-heated
closets or kilns, where the process of drying
is carried on evenly though rapidly. Kiln-dried
lumber, therefore, retains its shape quite as well
as that which is dried slowly in the lumber pile.
But whether kiln-dried or not, it should be allowed
to remain in a dry place as long as possible before
using it so that it will have a chance to change all
that it is likely to and so lessen the subsequent
shrinking and warping. A good cabinet-maker
never undertakes to make furniture from stock that
he does not know to be perfectly dry and well
seasoned, not only because unseasoned lumber is
more likely to shrink, warp, and crack, but also
because it cannot be depended upon to hold the
glue, take varnish well, or respond readily to other
methods of finishing.</p>

<p><i>Planing Down to a Flat Surface.</i>&mdash;Since boards
are seldom perfectly flat, even if one has taken the
greatest pains to select well-seasoned stock, it will
almost invariably be necessary to work them down
to a plane surface when they are glued up or joined
together in any way. To accomplish this result
it is necessary to plan the arrangement of the pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
in such a way that the concave of the bend shall
fall on the same side, as shown in the illustration,
and thus provide for the final working down with
the least possible removal of stock. They can be
arranged on a level bench top or floor with the
convex side down so that they will lie as flat as
possible. The boards should then be taken out
one by one and their edges should be carefully planed
so that they will match together in the position in
which they are laid. It will be necessary to take
each board from its place and return it several
times in order that this matching may be made as
perfect as possible. The object of all this is to prevent
the entire arrangement from springing&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
from acquiring any new bend or twist when the
parts are glued up. In joining boards to form
large pieces of glued-up work, like table tops, it
is customary to strengthen the joints by means
of dowel pins. Small table tops and similar work
may be safely glued up without dowelling.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_158.jpg" width="500" height="61" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Boards placed for planing to flat surfaces</div>
</div>

<p><i>Fastening Glued-up Work.</i> It will be readily
understood upon a little reflection that all plain
glued-up work should be allowed to move slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
upon the framework to which it is attached; for
even after it is well seasoned and well finished all
woods will swell slightly in a damp atmosphere
and shrink slightly when the air is dry, the greatest
movement being across the grain. Solid table
tops, therefore, should never be fastened down
firmly upon the framework with glue or with screws,
but should be secured by means of buttons screwed
to the under side of the top which travel in grooves
cut in the framework and thus allow for expansion
and contraction. A drawing is shown to illustrate
the method of attaching the table-top buttons.
Much of the warping and splitting of furniture is
due to the failure of the designer or maker to observe
this precaution.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_159.jpg" width="400" height="277" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Method of fastening table tops</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>In planing up stock, whether it be a single piece
or several glued together as just described, the
cabinet-maker planes off one side first and then,
using this side as the working face, gauges to the
required thickness and planes off the other side if
necessary. If the work be upon glued-up stock,
it is well to plane off the projecting edges of the
concave sides first, as that is generally somewhat
easier and may be all the planing that will be necessary.
If it be single pieces of stock that need
to be planed up, the natural twist or "wind" is
first planed out to a flat working face on one side
before putting the plane to the opposite side.</p>

<p><i>The Surface Plate.</i>&mdash;Planing to a flat surface requires
some device to guide the eye. If the surface
be very uneven at first, a beginning may be made
in the planing without much assistance; but a
point will finally be reached when neither the unaided
eye nor the hand can determine whether or
not a surface is flat. To determine this a surface
plate, as it is called, is needed. This consists of a
block of cast-iron, thick enough to prevent it
from being bent&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, an inch or more&mdash;and with
a somewhat rough but perfectly flat surface on
one side. This surface is well chalked over. When
the wood surface which is being planed down is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
laid upon this chalked surface and slightly moved
it is readily seen that the highest places on the wood
will become marked with the chalk and so indicate
to the cabinet-maker what parts are to be removed.
By making several tests of this kind he is able to
plane to a good flat surface.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_161.jpg" width="500" height="160" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Winding sticks</div>
</div>

<p><i>Winding Sticks.</i>&mdash;If the amateur's workshop is
not provided with a surface plate, a simple means
of testing for a flat surface is by means of two
narrow straight edges or "winding" sticks, placing
them on their narrow edges across each end of the
piece, as shown in the illustration, and sighting
across their upper edges. The slight projections
in the surfaces of the board can be determined in
this way and planed off until the two top edges
of the sticks are found to be level. These winding
sticks are simply wooden strips, accurately made,
with opposite faces parallel. Their dimensions
may be 1 &times; 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 30 inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Importance of True Surfaces.</i>&mdash;It may be well to
add that all this care to produce flat and parallel
surfaces is not merely for the purpose of giving a
good appearance to these surfaces. True surfaces
are necessary for the good of the work as a whole,
for they form the basis from which other surfaces
are gauged and other parts "trued up"&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
made square or otherwise geometrically correct.
When the main surfaces of a piece of cabinet work
are properly shaped, all the framework and other
parts may be brought into line without bending
or twisting. All such strains should be religiously
avoided in good cabinet work. The natural curves,
twists, or projections of the stock used should be
removed by the use of the proper tools and never
be strained to force any of the parts into
their proper places or shapes. Such efforts
produce strains which are transmitted to other
parts, displacing them, causing new defects
or a general failure of the parts to support each
other.</p>

<p><i>A Systematic Plan of Work.</i>&mdash;When the cabinet-maker
undertakes to make either a single piece of
furniture or several pieces, he goes about it in a very
systematic way. Consulting his working drawing
he makes an accurate list of the different pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
that will be required. For example, if he is to make
a Morris chair he notes the fact that he will need
four legs or posts 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches square by 22<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches long, a front rail and a back rail each <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times;
2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 22 inches, two side rails <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 24
inches, and so on until the list of necessary parts is
completed. With this list in hand he makes a careful
selection of the lumber and prepares the pieces
in the rough, allowing economically for the necessary
working waste. Economy of time and labour is also
secured by keeping together all parts on which similar
work is to be done. Thus, if several parts are to
be sawed to the same width or fashioned to the same
curves, it is generally the best plan to work these
parts out together while the machines and tools
are set for this purpose. Such a plan not only
saves time but, partially at least, it obviates the
danger of mistakes. It is important also to follow
a systematic order of work. All sawing to rough
dimensions should be done before the pieces
are dressed to drawing dimensions, and the
latter operations should generally all be completed
before laying out and cutting the joints.
As the work progresses toward completion
great saving of time and much comfort will
result from keeping the completed parts in good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
condition and so arranged that they can be easily
assembled.</p>


<h3>GLUING</h3>

<p><i>Necessity of Good Joints.</i>&mdash;After the selection
and preparation of the material for the stock, the
next important general process that demands attention
is gluing; for good cabinet work implies
good glue and a knowledge of how to use it. Prepared
glue, such as is sold in bottles, is unsatisfactory
for work of any consequence. A good woodworker
always has his own glue pot and sees to it that it
may be made ready for use on short notice. The
glue should be fresh, thin, and hot. It should be
applied quickly in a warm room and the parts to
which it is applied clamped up quickly before the
glue chills. It is the glue which penetrates the wood
that holds the parts together and not a layer of
glue between the joined edges or surfaces. It is
therefore evident not only that joints and surfaces
should be well smeared with glue, hot and thin
enough to be quickly absorbed, but also that the
parts should be clamped up quickly while the glue is
still hot so as to prevent any surplus from remaining
in the joint. This is an additional reason for making
close fits in all joints&mdash;in those which are to
be glued up as well as in those which are not. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
is a common fault of beginners to be satisfied with
loose mortise and tenon joints, counting upon the
glue to fill up the spaces. Much of the furniture
found in the markets falls to pieces for the same
reason. Such work should never be allowed to pass.
It is based upon an entirely mistaken notion of
the true office of glue and is nothing more nor less
than a falsehood in wood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 499px;">
<img src="images/i_165.jpg" width="499" height="179" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Method of holding framing parts square while glue is setting</div>
</div>

<p><i>Systematic Methods Required.</i>&mdash;As in the preparation
of stock and working it up, so in gluing, system
is all important. The hand screws or clamps should
be made ready and adjusted to the required width
so that they may be quickly placed in position as
soon as the glue is applied. The whole process
must be managed as quickly as possible because
the joints must be tested before the glue has had
time to set. A carpenter's large square should be
used for testing the right angles, since it is more reliable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
than the small try squares. It will frequently be
found necessary to hold framing pieces square while
the glue is hardening. This can easily be done by
nailing small strips of waste stock across the parts,
as shown in the drawing. A beginner should be cautioned
not to attempt to glue up too many joints at
one time. Two opposite corners of a framing piece
should be glued up separately and left to set before
the attempt is made to glue the whole rectangle
together. The two remaining joints, however, should
be glued and clamped together at the same time.</p>


<h3>PICTURE FRAMING</h3>

<p><i>Inexpensive Framing Stock.</i>&mdash;Picture-frame stock
can be easily obtained of dealers in artists' supplies
and in furniture stores in a great variety of styles.
Much of it is so well prepared and so nicely finished
that it leaves little to be desired. It is, therefore,
often best to secure the stock for frames in this way.
It is, however, somewhat expensive, so that, when
economy is important, it behooves the young woodworker
to prepare his own framing stock.</p>

<p>Very satisfactory frames 2 inches in width or
less may be made from matched oak flooring, a
section of which is here illustrated, by planing off
the tongue and cutting away one side of the groove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
to furnish the inset for the glass. Wider flat frames
of any thickness can, of course, be cut out from the
ordinary stock. A special tool for cutting the
inset is desirable but not necessary. A <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch
saw cut may be made with a circular saw or even
with a hand saw and the necessary removal of the
wood accomplished by means of careful chiselling.</p>

<div class="caption">The mitre joint</div>
</div>

<p><i>Mitres.</i>&mdash;Frames may be joined at the corners
in various ways. A common way is by the mitre
joint illustrated in the drawing. To secure good
joints of this kind it is necessary that the mitres
be cut on an angle of exactly 45 degrees and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the pieces for the corresponding sides of the frame
be precisely of the same length. Hand sawing is
generally not exact enough to produce angles of
sufficient accuracy even when an ordinary mitre
box is used. Hand-sawed mitres, therefore, will
require a little truing with a small plane. Great
care must be exercised also in fitting the corners
together. The common bench square is not large
enough to prove the work. A better way is to lay
a carpenter's framing square on the bench and fit
the two pieces of the frame against the sides of the
square, testing each corner in that way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_169.jpg" width="400" height="522" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Clamping mitre joints</div>
</div>

<p><i>Gluing the Joints.</i>&mdash;If the corners are unusually
well fitted, a good joint can be made by first sizing
the ends with glue and then firmly pressing the pieces
together upon a true surface, leaving them undisturbed
for four or five hours until the glue is hard.
By sizing the ends of the joints is meant thoroughly
filling the end pores with glue, rubbing it into the
pores with another block. Generally speaking,
however, it is necessary to make use of a mitre-clamping
device. If a special clamping device is
not available, one can be easily made by gluing small
soft wood blocks to the parts of the frame near the
corners, as shown in the accompanying drawing.
In a half hour or so these blocks will become firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
set so that the mitre joints may be glued together,
clamping them up with a hand screw. As already
explained under the general directions on gluing,
it is good practice for a beginner to glue up opposite
corners and not attempt to glue up the two
remaining corners until the first two are well set.
When the first two corners are well set they should
be nailed; and before the two remaining corners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
are glued it is well to try the parts together to see
if they do not require a little correcting before
gluing. These joints also should have light nailing
after the glue has been set. In nailing, small holes
should be made with a brad awl or drill in order to
avoid splitting the corners, and long finishing nails
should be used.</p>

<p><i>The Defect of Shrinking.</i>&mdash;With proper tools the
mitre joint is the easiest one to make, but it has
one unavoidable defect, especially in wide frames.
It is very difficult to get stock well seasoned and
almost impossible to get it perfectly seasoned, so
that wide frames, however well finished, must be
expected to shrink a little after they are joined
together. As most of this shrinking is across the
width of the stock it is evident that it will tend
to open the mitre joints on the inside of the corners.
This is what happens almost invariably with joints
made in this way from wide stock in picture framing.
The same defect is also frequently observed
in the interior finishing around windows and doors.</p>

<img src="images/i_171.jpg" width="250" height="183" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Halved lap joint</div>
</div>

<p>There are three other methods of joining the corners
of picture frames&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, the halved lap joint,
the mortise and tenon joint, and the dowelled joint.
A drawing is shown to illustrate these three kinds
of corner joints, and it is hardly necessary to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
that no one of them is open to the same objection
that attaches to the mitre joint. All these joints
require accurate cutting and rather more of it
than the mitre joint
requires, but they are
more easily glued up. The
halved lap joint is easily
clamped up with a common
hand screw, even when the
frame is a very large one.
But the other two require long clamps in order to
pull the joints up well.</p>

<div class="caption">Dowelled joint</div>
</div>

<p><i>Character of the Frame.</i>&mdash;The kind of joint required
depends upon the general character of the frame&mdash;whether
it is to be heavy or light, wide or narrow,
and whether made of picture frame moulding or of
the plain framing stock with round or flat face;
and the character of the frame is a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
design, determined by the kind of picture, by its
setting, and by other considerations discussed in
Chapter III. How the plan for
the construction of the frame
for any given picture is influenced
by such considerations may be
seen in the example which
follows:</p>


<h3>MAKING A FRAME FOR A LARGE
PHOTOGRAPHIC REPRODUCTION</h3>

<p>This photograph is 60 inches
long by 16 inches wide. It is a
copy in brown tones of a classic
painting by Otto Kneille&mdash;<i>The
Education of Athenian Youth</i>, the original of
which hangs in the Royal Gymnasium in Berlin.
It represents a spacious hall or court showing
three of the large marble columns and a massive
seat in which an old man reclines while
another old man is expounding some doctrine
to him and to a group of younger men gathered
around. In the centre of the scene a boy lies
flat upon the pavement reading a manuscript.
Near him several youths under the direction of
a master, are contending in feats of strength.
The composition is one that suggests weight and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
power. It may appropriately hang in the hall or
in the library over a wide, low bookcase.</p>

<p>A picture of this character needs no mat and must
have a wide, heavy frame. The stock chosen was
oak, 4 inches wide, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches thick, and flat faced.
The size and weight of such a frame, including the
glass, demand firmness of construction as the first
consideration. The stock is too wide for successful
mitring because shrinking would naturally open
and weaken such joints. It was therefore framed
together with mortise and tenon joints, well glued.
A dowelled joint might have sufficed, but it would
not have the same strength. The mortises were
cut in the vertical ends and the tenons were left
on the long horizontal pieces. This was in conformity
with the usual method of joining framework&mdash;for
example, door frames, window frames, panel
frames, and other interior woodwork; for the greatest
possible length is invariably given to the
vertical parts.</p>

<p>The frame was given a dark brown finish, repeating
the darkest tones of the picture. Long screw
eyes were fastened to the back 2 inches from the top,
so that the picture might hang nearly flat against
the wall. A strong braided wire about 75 inches
long was run through the eyes and securely looped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
at each end, so that a little more than an inch of
wire on each side passed through the eyes. Since
the picture was to have a prominent place on a
certain wall, two nails 66 inches apart allowing
for the two widths of the frame as well as for the
length of the picture were driven into this wall,
and the heavy photograph was easily hung and
balanced without exposing the wire to view.</p>


<h3>TO MAKE A KNOCK-DOWN BOOKCASE</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_174.jpg" width="300" height="380" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A knock-down bookcase</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;The problem of design was to plan
a simple, inexpensive
bookcase which could
be easily transported
and set up in a student's
room and which would
hold approximately
two hundred books.
The drawings show
how these requirements
were met in the design.
When in use it is held
together by keyed
shelves at the top and
bottom. The necessary stiffness is given to it by
the base pieces which are fastened both to the sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and to the bottom shelf by screws. Additional
stiffness is given by drawing up the three middle
shelves to the sides by means of screws. Upon
removing the screws and the keys the bookcase is
easily taken apart so that it may be crated in compact
form for transportation. It is equally easy
to set it up again. It has no back and may therefore
stand away from the wall as well as against it.
Its contour is plain, with few curves, giving a simplicity
which will harmonize with modest surroundings
and yet not bar it from keeping company with
more pretentious furnishings.</p>

<p>The original of this design was actually made up in
white wood, stained and finished to harmonize with
black walnut furniture; but it may be made up in oak,
ash, cherry, or any of the common woods used for
furniture. For one bookcase the stock required is
as follows, the sizes allowing for finishing to the
dimensions as given in the drawing: For the ends,
two pieces <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch &times; 10<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches &times; 4 feet 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches;
for the short shelves, three pieces <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch &times; 10<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches &times; 3 feet 1 inch; for the long shelves, two
pieces, <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch &times; 10<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches &times; 3 feet 5 inches; for
the base pieces, two pieces <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch &times; 6<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; inches &times; 3
feet; for the keys, one piece <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch &times; 1 foot.
In addition to this there should be two dozen No. 10<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
round-headed blued screws, and one half dozen
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch No. 10 flat headed blued screws.</p>

<p>The tools needed are as follows: Rip saw, cross
cut saw, back saw, compass, jack-plane, smoothing
plane, block plane, spokeshave, try square, steel
square, rule, knife, hammer, mallet, screw-driver,
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>, and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> inch bits and bitstock, and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inch chisels, gauges, and sand-paper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_176.jpg" width="500" height="366" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Details and dimensions for a knock-down bookcase</div>
</div>

<p><i>Construction.</i>&mdash;All the stock should be jointed,
planed to width, and smoothed with sand-paper.
The two end pieces should be squared to length,
the top corners rounded, and the curve at the
bottom cut as shown in the drawing. Care should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
be exercised in sand-papering not to round the
edges. The correct spacing for the shelves should
then be marked off on the end pieces and squared
across, care being taken to have both ends spaced
alike. To do this plane the ends together, with their
edges flush; and, beginning at the bottom, measure
off each of the spaces with correct allowance for the
thickness of the shelf and mark these spaces across
the edge. Then, separate the end pieces and with
the marks on the edges as a guide, square across
each of the end pieces on the inside
and mark with a knife. In allowing
for the thickness of the shelves it
should be remembered that the
stock, though originally <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an
inch in thickness, has been planed
and sand-papered, some of the
shelves perhaps having been finished
down more than others. It will
therefore be necessary to measure and allow for
the thickness of each shelf separately.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_177.jpg" width="200" height="283" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Method of gaining-in
the shelves</div>
</div>

<p>The three middle shelves are "gained" in&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
set into grooves in the upright ends&mdash;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an
inch deep, as shown in the sketch. It will be better
craftsmanship if the grooves are not carried across
the full width of the end pieces but stopped, say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
one inch from the edge, the shelves being cut
to fit, as shown in the drawing. If this be
done, the grooves should be cut out carefully
with a chisel. If the grooves be carried across
the full width of the end, they may be cut down
with a back saw and then chiselled out.
To insure a good fit in either case care should be
exercised not to cut outside the knife lines.
Chisel the bottom of the grooves carefully
so that they will be uniformly <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch
deep.</p>

<p>The next step is to cut the mortises for the top
and bottom shelves. The dimensions for these
should first be laid off on the stock by means of a
gauge. They should then be bored well inside the
marks and carefully chiselled out. Before this chiselling
is done, however, knife lines should be marked
on the outside of the end pieces exactly opposite the
gauge lines. In mortising, as in cutting the grooves,
the greatest care will need to be exercised that the
chisel does not cut outside the knife lines. In
working for a close fit it is better to err on the side
of removing too little stock at first, if one must
err at all, since it is quite easy to remove a little
more in the final fitting. It is quite impossible
to replace stock once removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>In measuring for the length of the shelves it should
not be overlooked that the top and bottom shelves
are to carry the tenons to be keyed through the end
pieces. These tenons should be cut out accurately
with a rip saw, and the stock between them removed
with a chisel after a deep knife line has been made.
After fitting these tenons to the mortises and finishing
them, the mortises for the keys should be
cut, using a small chisel. It should not be overlooked
that the outside face of each key mortise
is cut on an angle, as illustrated.
The three middle shelves are
then cut to length, the ends
squared by means of a block
plane, and corners cut out to fit
the grooves.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_179.jpg" width="300" height="343" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Details of the keys</div>
</div>

<p>The parts are now ready
to be put together temporarily
and squared up in order to fit in the base
pieces more perfectly than could be done by mere
measurement. It will add a pleasing detail to set
back these base pieces <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch from the
front and back faces.</p>

<p>After all the parts are carefully fitted they should
be assembled and the key and screw fastenings
inserted. When this is accomplished the bookcase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
is ready for finishing. As this is a distinct part
of furniture making it is reserved for treatment
in a later chapter.</p>


<h3>A HANGING BOOK RACK</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_180.jpg" width="500" height="385" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A hanging book rack</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;It is designed to plan a light but
strong book rack, to be fastened to the wall of a
chamber. Since it is intended to occupy the space
that might be given to pictures it is properly as
simple in construction as a picture frame, depending
upon good proportions and symmetry to give a
pleasing effect. The straight lines of the design,
which is illustrated above, meet these requirements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and also harmonize with the general
form and outline of books. Both shelves
may be used for books, if desired, but the design
permits them to be confined to the lower shelf,
reserving the upper one as a suitable place for a
bit of pottery or two, or some other choice bit of
bric-&agrave;-brac. The mortise and tenon joints give
the essential stiffness and strength without requiring
the use of heavy stock.</p>

<p><i>Materials and Tools.</i>&mdash;Since strength with lightness
is an essential feature to realize in the working
out of this design, soft woods should be avoided.
Ash is probably the strongest of the light woods in
common use. Oak is much stronger but heavy and
hard to work. White wood is comparatively light
and very strong. Gum wood is classified with ash
excepting that it is closer grained. Since this
book rack is to be used in a chamber in which the
wood trim is in enamelled white and most of the
furniture of a mahogany finish, it will be equally
appropriate to make it of white wood, to be finished
in enamelled white, or of bay wood as a basis for
mahogany finish. It was decided to adopt the
latter course.</p>

<p>The stock requirements for carrying out this
design are as follows: 2 back posts, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch &times;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch &times; 24 inches; 2 front posts, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch &times;
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 18 inches; 2 centre uprights, <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 1 &times; 18
inches; 1 back rail, <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 37 inches; 1 end
rail, 1 &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 44 inches; and 2 shelves, <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 7
by 37 inches.</p>

<div class="caption">Construction details and dimensions for hanging book rack (front)</div>
</div>

<p>The tools needed are much like those required
in the previous problem&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, the same planes,
saws, bitstock, squares, and the gauge; but there
will be needed a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch bit, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch
chisels, a knife rule, a rabbet plane, a mitre box,
and a mallet.</p>

<div class="caption">Construction details
and dimensions for
hanging book
rack (end)</div>
</div>

<p><i>Construction.</i>&mdash;The details of construction required
are as follows: Dressing the stock pieces,
cutting the posts to length, cutting the points on
the posts, rabbeting the cross rails and cutting them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
to length, cutting the mortise and tenons, halving
on the end rails, cutting and fitting the shelves,
cutting, fitting, and fastening the back rail,
arranging the clamps and other
appliances for gluing up, and cleaning
off the glue after hardening.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_184.jpg" width="300" height="206" alt="" />
<div class="caption">How the tenon is applied to the rail</div>
</div>

<p>The stock pieces should be first
"dressed" down to the drawing dimensions.
This means that they
should be planed and sand-papered
preparatory to laying out the cutting
dimensions. The front and
back posts should be cut to length
in the mitre box, care being taken
to allow an extra <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch for the
pointed ends at the top and bottom.
These pointed ends are cut in the mitre
box by raising one end of the post and sawing
to lines squared around the post <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch from
the other end. The angle of the cut is made
uniform by resting the raised end of the
post on a block lightly nailed on the inside
of the mitre box, thus giving the same elevation
for all the posts. The 1-inch by 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch
piece for rails is rabbeted out, using the plane
designed for that purpose, and afterward cut to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
length as called for. The blind mortises should
be made not more than <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an inch deep, and the
tenons <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> of an inch shorter in order not to strike
the bottom of the mortise. One of these rails
should be accurately laid out with knife lines and
the rest marked
from this as a
pattern. The
drawing shows the
location of the
tenon with reference
to the part of
the rail on which
the shelf rests.
This is the most convenient position for cutting the
tenon and it also gives greater strength. The centre
uprights should be halved on after the end rails
are in position, being cut for this purpose as illustrated
in the drawing. They may be allowed to
stand out <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an inch beyond the face of the end
rail, and in making the joint an equal amount of
stock is to be taken from the rail and from the
upright. The shelves are then easily cut to length
and the ends fitted with the block plane and dropped
into place, being lightly glued and nailed with
brads from the under side of the rabbet. Finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the top back rail should be halved in, being left
to the last in order that the more important fitting
of the shelves may be more easily accomplished.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_185.jpg" width="200" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption">How the centre
uprights are
halved on</div>
</div>

<p>In gluing up the mortise and tenon joints care
must be exercised to set clamps out ready for use
before the glue is applied so that the
parts may be promptly drawn up in
position. After gluing they should be
allowed to remain about ten hours in
order that the glue may properly harden
before the clamps are taken off.
All the extra glue squeezed out of
the joints in clamping must be scraped
off with a chisel, after the glue has
hardened a little; and any remaining
spots of glue must be carefully
removed with fine sand-paper so as not to leave
anything to interfere with the filling and finishing.</p>


<h3>AN UMBRELLA STAND</h3>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;So far as the question of use is
concerned, no problem of design could be more
definite than this one, since an umbrella rack can
have but one use. The only elements of beauty
possible are found in simplicity, proportion, and
the general effectiveness of the construction for
meeting the demands of use. The drawing shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
four square, straight posts, squared at the ends,
which are allowed to project a little above the top
to avoid a box-like effect. All the
joints are mortised except the division
bars at the top. The cross pieces at
the base are made wider not only to
conceal the drip pan but to give a
more stable appearance to the whole
rack.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_186.jpg" width="150" height="303" alt="" />
<div class="caption">An umbrella stand</div>
</div>

<p><i>Materials and Tools.</i>&mdash;Oak is selected
as perhaps the most appropriate
wood; but other woods, if the surroundings
require it, may be used to good
advantage. Oak is one of the strongest and most durable
of the woods used for furniture and takes well a
great variety of finish. It is also quite easily obtained.</p>

<p>The stock requirements are as follows: Four corner
posts 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 27<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches; four top rails
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 9 inches; four base rails <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 3 &times; 9
inches; two division bars <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 9<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches;
four cleats <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 9 inches; and one board <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times;
7<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 7<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches to support the pan.</p>

<p>The same tools in general will be required as in
the previous exercises, but it will be necessary to
add a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch bit, a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch chisel, a steel scraper,
and two short clamps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_187.jpg" width="500" height="719" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Details and dimensions for umbrella rack</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Construction.</i>&mdash;All the stock should be planed
to size, scraped, and sand-papered with the exception
of the base board for the pan, since that is hidden
from view. The scraper corrects all slight
unevenness of surface and removes scratches and
other blemishes. Care should be taken in sand-papering
to rub always with the grain of the wood
and to avoid rounding the corners. The corner
posts should first be cut to proper length and the
tops and bottoms slightly chamfered. Mortises
are then to be located, bored, and chiselled up.
The top and bottom rails should be laid off and the
tenons gauged and cut, care being taken not to have
them too long. The inside edges of the tenons have
to be pared off slightly, as illustrated in the drawing,
to allow room for each when they come together.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_188.jpg" width="500" height="212" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Top rail tenons (left) and Bottom rail tenons(right)</div>
</div>

<p>The next step is to assemble the parts, clamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
them up, and test them for accuracy. While these
parts are in the clamps, measurements should be
taken for the cross pieces, which may then be made,
allowing extra length of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch in each end
for the tenons to enter the top rails. These cross
pieces are to be halved together at the centre, as
shown in the drawing. The base rails are designed to
be thick enough to take up all the space on the inside
of the posts so as to hide the corner, as illustrated
in the sketch showing the bottom construction.</p>

<p>The next step is to assemble the parts for gluing.
It is not necessary to explain this process in detail,
since it has already been thoroughly explained in
the general section on gluing. It is not necessary
to glue on the cleats on which the pan rests; they
may be nailed in. When the base is glued together
measurements may be taken for the pan.</p>


<h3>A MAGAZINE STAND</h3>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;This problem calls for an attractive
article of furniture which should also be useful as
a receptacle for magazines and current newspapers.
An enclosed portion between two of the shelves
is desired to conceal from view and preserve for a
time the more valuable papers, parts of magazines,
or clippings, as may be found convenient. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
perspective sketch on this same page shows how
these simple requirements are met. The overhanging
top adds character and strength to what
might otherwise seem too light
for the load it is intended to
carry.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Materials and Tools.</i>&mdash;Oak is
selected as a suitable wood because
of its strength and
durability; for this stand
is likely to be in almost constant
use. A light wood, delicately
finished, would soon
show wear.</p>

<p>The stock list, according to the drawing, may be
itemized as follows: 4 corner posts 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times;
36 inches; 4 upright slats <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 1 &times; 34 inches; four
shelves <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 10<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 17 inches; one piece for the
top <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 14 &times; 21 inches; 2 top rails 1 &times; 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times;
12 inches; 1 piece for the door <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 8 &times; 15<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches
for the ends and the back of the closet 1 piece <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 8
&times; 36 inches; 1 pair 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch brass butts with screws
for the hinges, and one brass knob or catch.</p>

<p>The tools needed are a jointer, a block plane, a
smoothing plane, steel square, try square, knife
gauge, fine cross cut saw, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch bit and bit stock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
key-hole saw, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch chisel, mallet, nail set,
hammer, screw-driver, and steel scraper.</p>

<p>The principal operations are as follows: Planing
to size; scraping and sand-papering stock; squaring
ends and smoothing them to the required length;
laying out gains at corner posts; making mortises
for top rails; making the rails; assembling the main
parts; fitting ends and sides of the closets; hanging
the door and putting on the fixtures.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Construction.</i>&mdash;Smoothing with the plane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and scraping are very important and they should be
completed before any sand-papering is done because
particles of sand (silica), adhering to the wood,
will dull the steel tools. All three operations are
needed to remove the marks of the machine tools
of the factory, in order to give a good finish in the
end. The scraper follows the plane, removing
the unevenness which the latter leaves on board
surfaces. Sand-papering gives the finishing touches.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_192.jpg" width="300" height="137" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Method of mortising</div>
</div>

<p>After the stock is well smoothed, the top and the
shelves should be squared off, cut to length, and block
planed. The posts should then be cut and accurately
trimmed to dimensions. They may be marked with
a knife line for the gains into which the corners
of the shelves are to be fastened. Since the posts
are perfectly square, no attention will have to be
given to their exact location in marking or cutting
the gains; but when
the mortising for the
rails is laid out, care
must be exercised to
mark them so that
the mortises will come on the proper faces for
assembling. In mortising for the top rail it is well
not to work up to the end of the post but to cut
back, say <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch, as shown in one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
details. The rails may now be laid off and the tenons
cut and fitted. It is exactly 8<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches between the
shoulders of the rails. Since the shelves are 10<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches wide, one inch is thus left on each side to be
gained into the posts.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_193.jpg" width="200" height="163" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Method of fastening shelf</div>
</div>

<p>The parts are now ready for the first assembling.
To do this it is convenient to have a clear bench
top on which the posts may be laid on one side, face
down. The rails and shelves may then be slipped
into place, the other two posts placed on top, and
the whole clamped firmly together. This is the
preliminary assembling for the purpose of testing
the accuracy of the work. If it be found all right,
it should be taken apart again, and, after glue has
been applied to the tenons and to the ends of the
shelves, the parts should be quickly re-assembled
and clamped up as before, with the angles kept true.
Before the glue hardens the
shelves should be nailed into the
posts, as indicated in the drawing.
In this case it is the nail
that is the main stay. The glue
is accessory, adding much to
the stiffness of the construction.</p>

<div class="caption">Method of fastening posts to the top</div>
</div>

<p>The top may now be set on and fastened by screws
or by brads driven through into the posts and well set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
so that they may be concealed by putty, coloured to
match the stain used. The end slats should be fastened
on in the same way. The back and ends of the
closet are next cut to size and bradded in. The door
is then fitted and, to break the surface a little, an
ornamental design
is cut in the
centre. Still further
relief is given
by setting in
the door <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an
inch from the
edge of the shelf and ends of the closet. The
door is now hung on brass hinges, the stop and
catch added, and the stand is ready for staining
and finishing.</p>


<h3>A LIGHT LIBRARY TABLE</h3>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;This is to be a table designed on
simple lines and of good proportions. It is to have
no drawer but as much shelf room as conveniently
possible. The under shelf is designed to be cut
out to allow a chair to be drawn up on either side.
The end shelves may be regarded as designed to
combine a bookcase with the table, thus adding
much to its usefulness.</p>

<p><i>Materials and Tools.</i>&mdash;For a table of this kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
oak is very appropriate. The following list gives
the stock required for one table. The widths
and the thickness are as called for in the drawing,
but the lengths are given
a little long to allow
for cutting. A board
not less than 9 inches
wide and 10 feet long
will be needed as stock
for the top, the dimensions
of which are <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times;
26 &times; 39 inches. A 10-inch
board, 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet in length, will also be
required for the shelves. There will also be needed
four legs 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 30 inches; eight slats <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
&times; 18 inches; two back pieces <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 2 &times; 20<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches;
two rails <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 3 &times; 32 inches; and two rails <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 3 &times;
20 inches.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_195.jpg" width="300" height="253" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A light library table</div>
</div>

<p>The same tools will be required as in the foregoing
problems excepting that a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch bit and
a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch chisel will be required for mortising, and
two 3-foot clamps.</p>

<p><i>Construction.</i>&mdash;The first step in the construction
is to dress the stock, smoothing, scraping, and sand-papering
it, and working the various parts to size.
The lengths, however, of all parts excepting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
legs are not cut accurately until, in the process of
construction, these parts are needed. The legs
are at once cut to length and the mortises laid out,
bored, and cut. A gain should also be cut in each
leg, into which the bottom shelf is to be fitted,
glued, and bradded from the under side. The end
and side rails may then be laid off for shoulders
and tenons, and cut. In this case the tenons should
be made <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of an inch wide.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_196.jpg" width="500" height="254" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Construction details and dimensions (a) front; (b) end</div>
</div>

<p>In gluing up, the top should receive attention
first, in order to allow the longest possible time
for testing the work under the inevitable changes
due to continued seasoning. Great care must always
be exercised in making the glued joints. It
is often necessary to make them over on account
of the development of cracks. Proper care, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
will prevent this. The general directions for gluing,
given at the beginning of this chapter, will be of
service.</p>

<p>As soon as the top has been glued the four short
side pieces may be glued to the shelf, taking pains
to make good joints before applying the glue.
It should be noted that the inside ends of these
short pieces are to be 15 inches apart, and it is important
that the ends on opposite sides should be exactly
squared across, as indicated in the drawings. This
may be accomplished by first locating the centre
of the shelf, at the intersection of lines, marked c
in the drawing, and measuring 7<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches each way
to the line of the back pieces, which are to run
across the whole bottom shelf. As soon as the glue
is hardened the ends should be squared and made
true to set into the gains when the table is assembled.
Finally, the legs, the rails, and the shelf may be
assembled, glued, squared up, clamped, and set aside
to harden before the clamps are removed.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to brad the shelf in from the under
side before the glue hardens. After standing a
few hours the table will be ready for the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch
strip which forms the back of the shelf. This is
to be fitted and bradded in. Then the slats may be
cut to length. They project slightly below the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
shelf, and are fastened in position by screws. The
top may be cut to length and its ends smoothed,
after which it may be fastened on the frame by
means of screws and buttons, as already described
in the early part of this chapter.</p>


<h3>A HEAVY LIBRARY TABLE</h3>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;This table, as the illustration shows,
is designed to be of simple style, without a drawer
or side shelves, and with the bottom shelf keyed
into the base rail.
Heavy, square legs,
and mortise and tenon
joints are called for.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_198.jpg" width="300" height="270" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A heavy library table</div>
</div>

<p><i>Materials and Tools.</i>&mdash;The
mission type
of furniture, to which
this design belongs,
suggests oak as the
fitting wood. The
stock for the top, the dimensions of which are to
be <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 28 &times; 44 inches, may be cut in three
pieces from a 10-inch board, 12 feet long. For
the shelf a board <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 12 &times; 43 inches is required.
There are needed also four legs 2<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times;
2<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 30 inches; two side rails <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 4 &times; 36
inches; two end top-rails <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 4 &times; 22 inches; two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
end bottom rails 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 4 &times; 22 inches; and for
keys a strip 1 &times; 2 &times; 28 inches.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_199.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Construction details and dimensions (front)</div>
</div>

<p>The same tools are required as were needed in
the foregoing problem.</p>

<p><i>Construction.</i>&mdash;Since this table has a larger
top than the light library table, even greater pains
must be taken than in the case of the smaller table
to join the boards for gluing up. All like parts
should be laid off together and the necessary mortises
and tenons cut and fitted, as in the previous
case. The two end rails may be glued into the legs
first and clamped, leaving the side rails to be put
in place last, when the bottom shelf may also be fastened
in without gluing by means of the tenons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and keys. The latter should be cut somewhat
longer than is really needed so that they may appear
to be as effective as they really are; and they
should be tapered at least <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of an inch in order
to drive up well. A small brad may be driven
in to keep them from getting loose when the work
shrinks.</p>

<h3>A BOOKCASE WITH GLAZED DOORS</h3>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;This is to be an upright bookcase,
with five shelves and an overhanging top. Some
variety of surface is afforded by the arrangement of
the sash, as indicated in the drawing. The shelves
are made to be adjustable, and not fixed as in other
problems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">Bookcase with glazed doors</div>
</div>

<p><i>Materials and Tools.</i>&mdash;The stock required for one
bookcase of this pattern is as follows: two end pieces
<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 11<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 48<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches; for the top and bottom,
two pieces <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 12 &times; 40
inches; four shelves <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times;
11 &times; 40 inches; for the
sides of the doors, four
pieces <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 2 &times; 45
inches; for the top and
bottom rails of the doors,
four pieces <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 18
inches; for the middle
rail, one piece <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 2 &times;
18 inches; for the sash,
one piece <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch
&times; 6 feet; for the back,
enough <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch stock to
cover the space 38 &times;
46 inches. In addition
to this there will be required four hinges, two catches,
a lock, and glass for the sash as dimensioned in
the drawing. It is not necessary, however, to
cut the small lights. One large pane of glass may
be set in the full width of the door so that the
small sash divisions may be apparent rather than
real.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The tools for this problem are the same as those
used in previous problems with the addition of a
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch bit and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch chisel, and a rabbet plane,
or a universal plane for cutting out the rabbet
for the glass.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_202.jpg" width="500" height="391" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Details and dimensions for bookcase</div>
</div>

<p>It is not necessary to give directions for the treatment
of the stock, since it is practically the same
as that employed in preceding problems. The
details for cutting dimensions are given in the
accompanying drawings. It would be well for the
young woodworker to study these carefully and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
make out a working plan of procedure similar to
that which has been outlined in other problems.</p>

<p><i>Construction.</i>&mdash;The first thing to do is to erect
the bookcase&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, to cut the sides, the top,
the bottom, and the back pieces to proper form and
dimensions, bring them into position, and fasten
them. It will be noticed that the sides and top are
rabbeted out, as indicated in one of the small
drawings, so that the edge of the back will not
show when it is nailed in position. The bottom
shelf is also made narrow enough to allow the back
boards to be brought down over it and nailed
to the edge.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_203.jpg" width="500" height="146" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Method of concealing ends of back boards</div>
</div>

<p>After the case is erected the doors should be laid
out according to the drawing for mortises and tenons,
and the inside edges rabbeted to give an inset for
the glass. If it is decided to use one large light
at the top of the door instead of six small ones,
the sash effect for this light will have to be made
of pieces thin enough to allow this arrangement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
When the doors are ready for setting the glass it
may be held in place by small <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> round strips,
bradded in behind it. Great care should, of course,
be exercised in gluing up the doors to avoid strains
which might give them such a twist that they
could not be fitted to the case. Careful fitting of
all the mortises and tenons and the usual assembling
of the parts of each door before gluing is attempted
is a wise precaution. It will also be wise to allow
a little stock for trimming off, both on the sides
and on the ends, when the doors are finally fitted in.</p>

<div class="caption">Details and dimensions for round centre table</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;This problem calls for a table of
mission style with square legs set into the circumference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of the table flush with the top and having
tenons exposed on the face of the legs. Simplicity
of form combined with strength characterizes the
design.</p>

<p><i>Materials and Tools.</i>&mdash;Quartered oak is recommended
for a table of this design. The stock
required for one table is as follows: four legs 2<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times;
2<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 27 inches; two cross rails 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 3 &times; 29 inches;
one piece of 3 &times; 12 &times; 20 inches for the curved rails;
and stock enough to make a round top 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inches
thick and 27 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>The only tools desirable to provide, in addition
to those previously used, are a trammel and spokeshave
or a circle plane.</p>

<p><i>Construction.</i>&mdash;The first step is to join up and
glue the top so that it may have ample time to harden
and dry while the other work is being accomplished.
The stock for the legs may then be dressed
and the bottom mortises marked and cut through
the posts. Care must be taken to transfer the
marks to the opposite side so that the mortises may
be accurately outlined on the face. Care must
also be taken in cutting the mortises, in order to
make good, clean joints. A dimensioned detail
of the top mortises, which are to receive the tenons
of the curved rail, shown on <a href="#Page_180">page 180</a>, should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
consulted before laying out this work. It should
be noticed that the legs project 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches above
the top rail. After the top mortises are cut the
cross bottom rails should be halved together and
the tenons laid off and cut. It will be noticed that
the projecting end of the tenons is to be bevelled
off, but this should not be done until the fitting is
completed.</p>

<p>In laying out the plan of work for the construction
of the curved rails the trammel comes
into use. With this, mark off carefully the inside
and outside curves on a thin piece of board and, with
a large steel square, draw straight lines from the
centre or pivot point, making an exact quarter circle.
This is shown in one of the drawings on <a href="#Page_180">page 180</a>.
Then, parallel with each straight line and on the
inside, mark off other lines one half the thickness of
the leg. This locates the shoulder of the tenon. The
pattern should then be carefully cut out of the
thin board and used as a template for marking out
on the stock the form of the curved rails. After
these rails are band sawed and smoothed, the
tenons may be cut.</p>

<p>When the framing parts of the table have all
been cut and fitted they may be assembled and glued.
Finally the top is placed face down on a bench top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
or on horses, and the inverted frame laid over it
and centred to give the correct position of the
insets for the legs. These should be laid off with
great care, the outline reproduced exactly on the
opposite side, and the stock cut out. The top and
frame should then be fastened together from the
under side. After a few finishing touches have
been given to the projecting ends and exposed
surfaces, the table will be ready for the filling and
varnishing.</p>


<h3>A LIBRARY DESK</h3>

<p>This is the most ambitious of the special problems
in furniture making here suggested. Details
are given in the drawings on the opposite page.
If the young woodworker can give sufficient time
to it and can command the services of a few machine
tools it will not be an unreasonable task to undertake.
Most of the operations required in its construction
have already been carefully explained
and need not be repeated as detailed directions.
There are, however, one or two principles of cabinet-making
called for in this problem which were not
required in the others. They will therefore need
explanation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p><i>Panelling.</i>&mdash;To avoid the difficulties which would
result from the swelling, shrinking, and warping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
of wide surfaces in furniture it is common practice
to make use of the panel. The design of the panel
is easily understood. It consists of a framework
of ordinary thickness, put together usually with
mortise and tenon joints. The inside edges of this
framework are grooved, and into the groove is
fitted a piece of stock generally thinner than the
frame which fills the space between the sides of
the frame. The panel board may be in one piece
of wide stock or it may be glued up. It may be
of very thin stock inset on both sides of the panel,
or it may be of thicker stock inset only on one side,
and perhaps not inset on either side, in which case
only the edges of the board are made thin enough
to run in the groove of the panel frame. In this
problem the panel board is to be made of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch
stock, flat on the outside, and inset <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch.
The back of the panel board is flush with the frame
and is chamfered off to give the necessary tongue
all around to run in the groove. The narrow stock
of the framework is not likely to swell or shrink
appreciably and, if well constructed, cannot become
warped or twisted. The panel, on account of
its greater width, may and generally does swell
and shrink considerably; but it should be fitted to
move easily in the grooves so that its changes may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
not be noticeable. Should it be desired to finish
the panels with a moulding this should be nailed to
the rails, not to the panel board.</p>

<p><i>Danger in the Power Saw.</i>&mdash;The panel frame
may be constructed by hand, but if a circular
saw be available it will be found of great service.
Beginners, however, should employ the services
of an expert sawyer and not assume the great risk
involved in the use of a circular saw or even a band
saw, especially if these saws are without guards. The
necessary operations should be carefully laid out
on the partially finished stock, with a good square
and gauge. A combination plane is quite essential
for cutting the grooves; and this carries its own
gauge. Care should be taken to make all measurements
from the centre of the piece, and gauge and
square always from the face sides and from the face
edges of the joints. The cuts that it is necessary to
make for the joints are indicated in the drawing. In
gluing up, the directions already given in the section
on gluing should be followed.</p>

<p><i>Sand-papering.</i>&mdash;There is a legitimate use for
sand-paper in the finishing stages of the work on
this desk, as there is, in fact, in almost every kind
of fine woodwork. Its use has already been advised
in the directions for furniture making. In furniture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
manufactories sand-papering machines are among
the most expensive machines to be found in the
shops; and their high cost is of course justified by
their productive value. It is quite impossible to
work down large pieces to a good surface by the
process of planing. If a sand-papering machine
is within easy reach of the amateur cabinet-maker,
it will be very desirable for him to send all large
pieces like the tops of tables and panel boards to
the factory in order to have them run through the
machine. The expense is very slight. In sand-papering
by hand considerable pressure should be
applied as evenly as possible and always along the
grain. Any movements directly across the grain
or at an angle are sure to show through the finish.
The process is facilitated by wrapping the sand-paper
around a block of wood about 2 &times; 4 inches in
diameter or, better still, a block of cork of the same
dimensions.</p>


<h3>A MORRIS CHAIR</h3>

<div class="caption">A Morris chair</div>
</div>

<p><i>History of the Design.</i>&mdash;Among furniture designs
the Morris chair has become a classic. It takes its
name for its originator, William Morris, the great
English designer and reformer, to whom, perhaps
more than to any other person, we are indebted for
sane and honest work in furniture design and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
all forms of household decoration, not only in
England but in other European countries and in
America. And probably no one of his creations
has done more to
teach the lesson of
simplicity, comfort,
and utility in
furniture than the
Morris chair.</p>

<div class="caption">Details and dimensions for Morris chair (side)</div>
</div>

<p>It may be well to
add, however, that
like many other
famous works of
art, the original
design of William
Morris has suffered
much in countless imitations. The furniture shops
display carved and otherwise embellished monstrosities
under the name of Morris chairs which are
nothing less than an insult to the great name they
bear. But the life of all imitations of original and
really great ideas is bound to be short. Only the
good and true, which are the original, survive. The
really valuable features of the original Morris chair
design, combining beauty of material with simplicity
of form and construction, have taken a lasting hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
upon the hearts of all people who have found solid
comfort in these chairs. The chairs contemplated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
this problem are illustrated on <a href="#Page_50">page 50, chapter II</a>.
Both are in quartered oak. The one on the right is
stained in dark brown and has a box cushion for the
seat and a pillow cushion for the back, in medium
brown leather. The one on the left is in light fumed
oak with cushions of mahogany velour. On account
of its smaller dimensions it is somewhat lighter
in weight than the one on the right, and the dimensions
of the smaller one will be followed in this
problem. This chair is an exact copy of one in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
ash which, with a centre table and stool, were
designed and made for a college girl's room; and a
large part of the work of constructing the three
pieces of furniture was done by the girl herself.</p>

<div class="caption">Detail of pins</div>
</div>

<p>By careful examination of the dimensioned drawing
shown on the preceding page the young woodworker
who undertakes this problem should select
his stock according to the following list: 4 legs
2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 24 inches; two arms 3 &times; 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 38
inches; two bottom side rails 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 6 &times; 26 inches;
two top side rails <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 26
inches; two bottom rails (front and
back) 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 6 &times; 24 inches; one top rail
(back) <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 24 inches; two
back uprights 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 1<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 25 inches;
three cross pieces for back (lower)
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 2<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 20 inches; one cross piece
for back (top) <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 6 &times; 20 inches;
one bracket 1 &times; 3 &times; 18 inches; four
pins 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches square.</p>

<p>In sawing up the stock, allowance
should be made of course, for necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
waste in working down to the drawing dimensions.
The arms are drawn with a curve and may be
fashioned by band sawing them out of 3-inch stock.
There will be a considerable saving in material and
labour, of course, if the arms are made flat; but the
effect of the curve is very pleasing. The back slats
may be sawed to a slight curve, which is another
attractive feature; but flat slats are easier to make
and just as serviceable.</p>

<p>The process of construction does not differ in
general from that already described in some of the
foregoing problems, and need not be repeated here
in detail. The method of finishing this and all
other furniture referred to in the problems will
be explained in the following chapter.</p>

<p>Since the Morris chair is a heavy piece of furniture,
it will be necessary to provide casters for it. The
Acme Pin caster, so-called, was used in the chair
referred to in this problem. It makes use of a steel
ball turning upon ball bearings, and is set up into
the legs so as to leave only about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch of
the ball exposed.</p>


<h3>A HALL CLOCK</h3>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_218.jpg" width="500" height="825" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A hall clock

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The original
of the hall clock was
designed and made by
Mr. Egbert E. MacNary.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>Design.</i>&mdash;This clock was designed and built to conform
to the requirements of the space allotted to it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
The lines of the case are all straight; there are no
spires or gables or fantastic curves on the top. A hall
clock is indoors, and the top should be horizontal;
for all the other lines such as tops of window casings,
picture moulding,
etc., are horizontal.
If the clock
stood out of doors
under the stars,
then the top might
be spired or
pointed.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_219.jpg" width="300" height="575" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Construction detail of a hall clock</div>
</div>

<p>The construction,
as indicated
in the sketches, is
simple and substantial.
The long
sides extend the
entire height of
the clock, being
firmly joined into
the base and head.
The works are supported
between
these sides. The
wood is <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
quartered oak, hand dressed, and stained a warm
brown. The dial, hinges, catches, pendulum, and
weight are of brass.</p>

<p><i>Cutting Glass with a Wheel Cutter.</i>&mdash;The long door
has a panel of transparent leaded glass. This
leaded glass work is a most fascinating process.
The lead strips required for it were purchased of a
dealer in lead specialties. Stained glass window
concerns are usually willing to sell this lead. A
full-size drawing was made of the design for the
glass panel and the glass cut in pieces to match the
pattern. A ten-cent wheel glass cutter was used.
One caution, kept in mind, will enable one to use
a wheel cutter of this kind without injuring it. <i>It
should never be used twice in the same cut.</i> One
stroke of a few inches over a cut previously made
will ruin the wheel; but if the wheel is not abused
by tracing over a cut, it will last a long time. The
glass should be laid on a level table and the cutter
used with a firm hand, making a continuous cut
against a straight edge.</p>

<p><i>Soldering.</i>&mdash;The long lines of the design are in one
piece; and there is a strip around the entire outside
edge. To solder the pieces together, the glass and
lead strips are laid in position on a board, and brads
(about 1 inch long) are driven part way into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
board close against the outside strips, so as to hold
the pieces in position. A small bead of soldering
paste is placed on each joint. A small soldering
"iron" (which is really copper) and wire solder are
used. The copper may be "tinned" by filing the
point bright, heating it, dipping it in the soldering
paste, and then quickly touching it to the solder
wire. The point will become coated with the
solder, or, as we say, "tinned." The iron will
need frequent heating. A quick, light touch of
the iron and solder wire to the joints will give the
best result.</p>

<div class="caption">Method of holding glass and lead strips for soldering</div>
</div>

<p>The two rings in the brass dial were "raised" by
driving the brass into a groove in a piece of oak with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
a hard wood wedge. The piece of oak was revolved
around the dial by means of a nail driven through
the centre of the dial into the oak piece. When a short
arc of the ring had been raised, the grooved piece was
swung around about 1 inch and the groove continued.</p>

<div class="caption">Dimensioned dial piece of clock

</div>

<p>The length of the pendulum depends upon the
number of teeth in the escape wheel. It was necessary
in the case of this clock to take out the escape
wheel, which had 32 teeth, and substitute one of 22
teeth to accommodate the length of pendulum desired.</p>


<h3>OUTDOOR FURNITURE</h3>

<p>The greatest charm of home life in the summer
season is rarely found within the house. This
is especially true in the village or in the country,
where nature is at her best; but even in city homes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
that are fortunate enough to include in their surroundings
a small yard, a bit of garden, or any
means of connecting the home
with "God's great out-of-doors,"
though it be but a
sheltered balcony or a window
garden, the touch of nature is
not lost. It is possible, however,
for art to assist nature;
and in many cases her assistance
is very much needed.
It is certainly true that nature cannot be left
wholly to herself in the neighbourhood of the
village or city home. If there be a garden, as
much forethought must be exercised in planning
it and as much pains taken in developing and caring
for it as is called for in working out any form of
interior decoration. There are problems of design
and construction suggested by the need of suitable
chairs and settles for the piazza, comfortable hammocks
and couches for the balcony, awnings for the
windows on the sunny side, and the right furniture,
perhaps, for an out-door dining-room. The more
decorative features are found in the rose arbours,
the trellises, the garden screens, the lawn tent,
the pergola, and the garden gate; and all these offer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
problems that easily come within the reach of
enterprising and capable young craftsmen.</p>

<p><i>General Types.</i>&mdash;In the designing of out-door
furniture there are two suggestions from nature
that may appropriately find expression. On the
one hand large masses, as seen in the hills and rocks,
suggest solidity, weight, and permanence. This
idea is embodied in walls of masonry, stone posts,
iron gates, stone or concrete pedestals, or in some
other kind of heavy construction. On the other
hand, there are the suggestions of lightness, delicacy,
and growth, seen in the growing vines, shrubbery,
and small trees, which are carried out in the so-called
rustic furniture, trellises, arbours, and garden
screens.</p>

<p><i>An Example of Heavy Furniture in Wood.</i>&mdash;A
settle designed for comparatively permanent use
in some cool or retired corner of the garden may be
made of native pine, white wood, or spruce, well
protected by several coats of paint. A suggestion
is here given for such a design, laid out on substantial
lines. Ordinary 4 &times; 4 spruce, planed, may be
used for the posts, pine or white wood for the rest
of the construction, 2-inch stock being used for the
back pieces and arms, and <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch boards for the
rails and seat. Mortise and tenon joints should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
used in the framing. The illustration shows also
a simple design cut in the back pieces and repeated
in the two front posts. It is a decorative feature
which seems to counteract, somewhat successfully,
the general severity of the lines on which the settle
is designed to be built.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_225.jpg" width="400" height="327" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A garden settle</div>
</div>

<p><i>Concrete Furniture.</i>&mdash;Still more substantial out-door
furniture may be made of concrete cement.
This material has come into use for sidewalks and
pavements and as a substitute for brick and stone
masonry in retaining walls, bridge abutments, and in
a great variety of heavy building construction. Concrete
is, in fact, an artificial stone, made by mixing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Portland cement with sand or pulverized rock in
the right proportions, thoroughly wetting the mixture
with water, and allowing it to harden. It is so
commonly associated with heavy, crude work that
it is not easy to believe that it may be also
fashioned into anything of an artistic or decorative
character; and yet it is capable of a wide range
of out-door decorative uses. Gate posts, pedestals,
fountains, window boxes, urns, and other forms of
garden pottery in great variety, tables, and garden
seats, have been successfully moulded in this material.
Its natural stone gray colour and surface are well
suited to many of these uses; but it may be given a
variety of colour effects in bold design if occasion
requires it. In weight and durability it leaves
nothing to be desired.</p>

<p><i>The Wire Form.</i>&mdash;Concrete cement cannot be
modelled like clay. In its formative state it is too
soft for such manipulation. It must be supported
in some way while it is being worked into the desired
shape and until it has hardened. In general
there are two methods of giving the necessary
support: <i>viz.</i>, by employing an interior framework
or skeleton, generally of wire lath, which is permanently
encased in the cement; or by using a
plaster or wooden mould into which the material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
in a soft and plastic state is poured and from which
it is removed when hardened. The latter method
has been elaborated quite extensively for commercial
purposes, because it readily yields an indefinite
number of marketable results from the same
moulds. The simpler wooden moulds may be easily
made by a clever boy; and after a little experience
he can soon learn how to mix the cement properly
and mould a form successfully. For single pieces
of concrete work, however, the wire forms are to be
preferred. A suggestive illustration of this method
is found in the following problem:</p>


<h3>A CYLINDRICAL GARDEN VASE</h3>

<p>The dimensions called for in this design are a
diameter of 10 inches and a height of 8 inches. The
wire form must therefore be made to approximate
quite closely to these dimensions. A good material
for the form is galvanized wire lath of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch
mesh. This problem will require a piece about
8 inches wide and 34 inches long for the convex
side, and a piece about 10 inches square for the base.
From the square piece a circle 10 inches in diameter
should be cut out. A strong pair of tinners' shears
will be needed for this purpose. In bending the
long piece into the cylindrical form it is well to
proceed slowly in order to produce an evenly curved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
surface&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, one free from angular bends. A
good way to accomplish this result is to lay the piece
down on a bench top and bend it up over a cylindrical
wooden block. If
nothing better is available
a rolling pin will serve
this purpose. When the
bending is nearly complete,
the two ends of the piece
should be brought together,
lapped over about an inch,
and bound together with
free ends of the strands of wire. A pair of pliers
will be of great assistance. If this part of the process
has been carefully done, there will result a
cylindrical form 10 inches in diameter. The circular
piece should now be attached to one end of
this form by means of the free ends of the strands
found there, bending the projecting wires over and
clinching them at convenient points on the circumference
of the circular piece where there are uncut
meshes of the wire. The form is now ready for
covering with the cement.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_228.jpg" width="250" height="278" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A garden vase</div>
</div>

<p>The first step is the mixing of the cement for what
is known as the scratch coat. This is made by
mixing Portland cement with fine, clean sand in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the proportion of one part cement to two of
sand. These ingredients should be thoroughly
mixed together in the dry state, and then there
should be added a small quantity of goats' hair,
well picked apart. For the problem at hand about
five pounds of cement will be needed and as much
goats' hair as can be held in the hand. The whole
should be thoroughly wet down with just the right
amount of water. It is important that the mixture
should not be made too soft. A scratch coat
should be given a consistency that will enable it
to be easily spread over the wire form and, at the
same time, to hang well together.</p>

<p>When a sufficient amount of the right mixture
has been obtained, it should be spread upon the
wire form by means of a small mason's trowel
or a large knife. It is well to begin at the bottom
of the convex side of the cylinder, working upward,
taking no pains to make this first coat smooth,
since roughness is desirable, and paying no attention
whatever to the inside of the cylinder, excepting
to see that the cement is forced well through the
meshes so that the whole mass will be held together
firmly when dry. The inside is given a smooth
coat as a part of the later finishing process. When
the convex surface has been well covered, the form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
should be turned bottom up and the cement spread
upon the base of the cylinder in the same way.
After the wire has been completely covered, the form,
which is likely to be somewhat distorted, should be
corrected by careful manipulation till a true cylinder
has been obtained. This is allowed to stand for
about five hours until the cement has thoroughly
hardened. It is then ready for the finishing coat.</p>

<p>The next step in the process is to make the cement
for the finishing coat. Considerable variety is
possible here, depending upon the colour and other
surface effects that are desired. In this design a
light, sparkling surface when finished is required.
To produce this effect a mixture of one part Portland
cement and two parts marble dust will be
needed. This should be mixed without hair to a
consistency like that used for the scratch coat.</p>

<p>Before applying the finishing coat the surfaces
should be thoroughly moistened by means of a
brush well filled with water. There are various
methods of applying this coat. The simplest is
carefully spreading it on with a trowel and smoothing
it with the moistened hand. When the surface
has hardened sufficiently it is sometimes possible
to improve the finish by the judicious use of sand-paper
or a coarse file. It is not possible to produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
perfectly even surfaces in this way; and yet the
method has the characteristic freedom of handwork
in general, and yields very satisfactory results.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_231.jpg" width="250" height="295" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A vase with blocked rim</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Decoration.</i>&mdash;A great variety of decorative
effects may be obtained in concrete pottery and in
other articles made of this material for out-door
use. In pottery these decorations may take the
form of raised figures or ornaments, of borders or
designs cut in the surface, and of inlays in colour.
Whatever the form of design, the necessary cutting
for it is best made when the cement has become well
set but not very hard&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, from 6 to 10 hours
after the finishing coat is applied. A stout, sharp,
pointed knife blade is all the
tool that will be required.
A narrow chisel, however,
may be found desirable for
deepening the cuts. The
knife should be guided by
means of a ruler, which
should be flexible if used on
curved surfaces; and the
depth of the cut will depend
somewhat upon the size of the piece. In work
similar to that described in the problem just
given, a depth of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> or <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch is sufficient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
This cutting, of course can be made after the
cement has hardened, by the use of hammer and
chisel; but it will be much more difficult.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_232.jpg" width="150" height="187" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A square form</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Colours.</i>&mdash;Colour cement for inlaid designs
is made by using the best quality of white Portland
cement as a base, colouring it with dry mineral
pigments which are sold by dealers under the name
of lime or cement-proof colours. Among the pigments
suitable for this purpose are red oxide of iron,
which produces a red; oxide of cobalt, which gives
a good blue; chromate of lead, which produces
yellow; carbonate of copper, which gives a good
dark green; and burnt umber, which yields a good
brown. These come as dry powders
and should be mixed with the dry
cement and marble dust, making a
mixture of uniform colour, before
the water is applied. In order to
determine the right colour it is
well to experiment with a small
quantity of the various ingredients until a satisfactory
shade has been found. Then with this as a
guide a sufficiently large quantity should be mixed,
in the same proportions, to the consistency of a thick
paste, and applied to the design, which has been
previously cut in the surface to be decorated. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
insure thorough adhesion of the paste to the concrete,
the cutting should be well moistened with
a wet brush. A number of suggestive designs
are shown in the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p><i>Rustic Furniture.</i>&mdash;The lighter out-door furniture
can be easily made up in a great variety of
designs. The form of rustic settles and chairs is
determined largely by the material which is available.
Very useful and ornamental effects are produced
by using sticks cut from the tops or from
branches of small trees. Birch saplings, easily
found in the second growth of some wood lots,
afford a good supply of material. It is not necessary
that the sticks be straight; the natural crooks
and notches are often very useful in bracing the
framework. Chairs, settles, tables, standards for
flower boxes, and other articles of furniture may
be made out of this rough and unfinished material.</p>

<p><i>Lattice Work.</i>&mdash;Trellises and garden screens have
been made in an almost endless variety of forms.
Among the most satisfactory is the plain lattice
work in squares and rectangles. Its simplicity
and evident durability are points in its favour.
Experience proves also that vines and other plants
needing support are readily adjusted to this form
of trellis. The size of the stock required in making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the right-angled lattice work depends upon the
uses to be made of it. For a garden screen the
uprights need to be of 2 &times; 2 inch stock and of
any convenient length. End posts of 3 &times; 3 inch
stock will be required, to give necessary stiffness;
and, if the screen be a long one, intermediate posts
of the same size should be placed at intervals of
ten or twelve feet. The horizontal pieces may be
strips of <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch stock, 2 inches wide, set their full
thickness into the uprights. Spruce furring, which
lumber dealers supply in 2-inch widths, is suitable
for the small rails; but if chestnut be used for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
uprights it is well to use the same wood for the rest
of the construction. The top and bottom rails
should be of heavier stock, not less than 2 by 3
inches. The best foundation is a line of concrete
posts, firmly set into the ground at intervals of 6
feet, to which the bottom rail or the uprights are
fastened by means of irons set into the cement when
the posts are formed. Two coats of dull green
paint will protect the wood and properly subordinate
the lattice work to the trailing branches which it
supports.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In the</span> commercial production of furniture the
cabinet-maker has nothing to do with the finishing
of his work. This essential part of furniture
making is turned over to artisans who are finishers
by trade. In a separate part of the factory they
attend to the cleaning and filling of the wood
and to whatever finish is applied to the work of
the joiner. It is hardly necessary to add that
the finishing of all kinds of woodwork is quite as
important as any other feature in its production;
for, however good the lines of design may be and
however thoroughly the design may be carried out
in the construction of any piece of furniture or
other woodwork, it may be and often is spoiled as
a work of art in the finishing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the amateur cabinet-maker should be his
own finisher. He should familiarize himself with
the various kinds of finish that may be applied to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the different woods. He should know the object of
filling wood and how it is done. He should understand
the processes of fuming, staining, and varnishing
so well that he can produce with certainty
the results desired.</p>


<h3>CLEANING, SURFACING, AND FILLING</h3>

<p><i>First Steps in Finishing.</i>&mdash;The first step in finishing
woodwork is to clean it up and prepare it for the
filler. Too great care cannot be taken in examining
all surfaces for slight oversights that have occurred
in the joinery work or for blemishes that have been
acquired in any part of the process of construction.
Light planing, chiselling, or scraping, and perhaps
a little sand-papering, always with the grain, may
be needed to remove these faults and blemishes.
The most serious of these generally result from gluing.
All surplus glue should be carefully removed,
even to the film that soaks into the surface of the
wood. The slightest spot of glue remaining will
keep the filler out of the wood and show through
any kind of finish.</p>

<p><i>Importance of Filling.</i>&mdash;As soon as the furniture
is thoroughly cleaned, if it is to be finished in the
natural color, the grain of the wood must be filled
with a light, transparent, semi-liquid substance,
known as the filler, which, after standing from five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
to seven minutes, should be thoroughly rubbed off
with a piece of coarse cloth or a handful of shavings.
This process, as its name indicates, fills the pores
of the wood and protects them against the absorption
of moisture and the consequent swelling. But
this is by no means its chief purpose. Strictly
speaking, filling is the ground-work of all subsequent
finishing processes and, for that reason, it may be
said to be the most important operation connected
with wood finishing. If improperly done, no amount
of good work with the varnish brush will remove the
fault. In fact, good work is impossible after a bad
beginning. Good varnishing or good finishing of any
kind requires that, before the final finishing processes
begin, the surface should be made perfectly
level and smooth, free from all unevenness or roughness
or minute openings of any kind that might
allow the varnish or other finishing material to
penetrate the wood. If the filling has not been so
thorough that no part of the subsequent finishing
material can be absorbed by the wood, a rough
surface will be sure to follow. This may, of course,
be rubbed down and re-finished, but never with
that perfection of result which is assured by laying
a good foundation in correct filling. It may be set
down as a fundamental principle of wood finishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
that the best result is obtained when the filling or
surfacing has been so thoroughly done that the
thinnest of finishing coats, few in number, are required
to produce the desired result.</p>

<p><i>Liquid Fillers or Surfaces.</i>&mdash;There are many kinds
of fillers in common use, but they may all be considered
as belonging to one or the other of two
classes. They are either liquid fillers or paste
fillers. Woods differ greatly in the coarseness or
fineness of their grain. The coarse or open-grained
woods require a filler with body enough to close up
the pores of the wood and give that perfectly even
surface necessary as a foundation for good finishing.
The close-grained woods, on the other hand, do not
present the same filling problem. They could not
absorb a paste filler. In fact, it is hardly too much
to say that the fine, close-grained woods, like maple,
gum wood, and birch, do not need a filler at all;
and there are some coarse-grained woods, like
southern or hard pine and cypress, the pores of
which are naturally filled with gummy or resinous
substances and will not absorb an artificial filler.
But all such woods <i>do</i> need to be given a finishing
surface which will prevent the finishing coats
from soaking into the fibre of the wood. This is
the office of the so-called liquid fillers, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
are very properly called "first coaters" or "surfacers."</p>

<p><i>How to Make a Liquid Filler.</i>&mdash;A standard formula
for the preparation of a liquid filler is as follows:
Mix four parts by weight of carbonate of soda with
six parts of china clay, and grind this mixture in
about eight parts of japan, thinning the product
with turpentine or benzine to the consistency of
linseed oil. Laundry starch may be used in place
of china clay, giving a filler which is somewhat
easier of application than the clay filler because
it does not settle. It lacks in durability, however,
especially if it is not well covered. The finest
grained woods do not require the addition of any
material to the filler to give body. A great variety
of liquids may be easily obtained which, without
being mixed with anything, will give the necessary
surface.</p>

<p>Glue size, water glass, and the cheaper grades
of varnish, thinned if necessary with benzine or
turpentine, are often used for this purpose. But
these are all inferior to the standard surfacers and
never should be used on the best grades of woodwork.
Shellac is always preferred as a first coater for hard
pine, as it keeps the resinous sap in the pores of the
wood and preserves the natural colour of the grain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
If oil is applied to hard pine without first applying
this protecting coat of shellac, the wood blackens
with age. Shellac is an excellent first coater for
other woods also. It is commonly used in house
finishing as the surfacer for the interior trims. But
it dries rapidly, and generally with a rough surface.
The first coating of shellac, therefore, requires careful
sand-papering before the varnish is put on.</p>

<p><i>Time Needed for a Shellac Coat to Dry.</i>&mdash;It may be
well to caution the amateur finisher as to the time
required for the thorough drying of shellac. While
it may be truly said to dry very rapidly, the first
drying is necessarily upon the outer surface, forming
a hard coating which delays somewhat the drying
throughout, so that a shellac filling is not really
dry enough to sand-paper a half hour or so after
it has been applied, though it may appear to be.
It is a good rule to allow at least twenty-four hours
for thorough drying; and it may be well to add that
all methods of filling, rubbing off, etc., require for
the best results more time than energetic workers
sometimes allow.</p>

<p><i>Cost of Surfacing.</i>&mdash;A practical question that the
amateur finisher will ask is, how can one know in
advance how much filler is needed for given pieces
of work, and what will be its cost? For a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
quality of liquid filler it is safe to say that one pint
will cover eight square yards with one coat. The
cost varies greatly, depending upon the quality
of the filler and whether it is home-made or obtained
of a dealer. A good commercial filler or surfacer
can be bought for $1.50 per gallon, making the cost
per square yard of one-coat surfacing about 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
cents. A small can costs 15 cents. Good work cannot
be done with the cheaper grades of filler. Shellac,
which is, all in all, the best of surfacers, can be
bought for $1.85 a gallon, which would make the cost
of surfacing somewhat under 3 cents a square yard.</p>

<p><i>How to Make a Paste Filler.</i>&mdash;A good paste filler,
such as is required for the open-grained woods like
oak, ash, baywood, and poplar or white wood, may
be made from pulverized and floated silica as a base,
thoroughly mixed with raw linseed oil, turpentine,
and japan in equal parts, with enough silica added
to the liquid mixture to form a good paste of a consistency
somewhat thicker than paper-hangers'
paste. If the mixture should prove to be a little too
thick, it may easily be thinned with turpentine.
The final mixing of this filler requires grinding in a
hand mill. Unless a considerable quantity of it is
needed it is quite as well to purchase a can of the
paste filler of a dealer in painters' or finishers' supplies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
though commercial fillers are not generally
quite so good as a one made on this formula.
They often contain wax and whiting and other
materials as a base which are not so satisfactory
in the long run as the floated silica.</p>

<p><i>How a Paste Filler is Applied.</i>&mdash;Paste fillers should
be spread on the surface to be filled very liberally
with a wide, stiff brush, allowed to stand from five
to seven minutes, and then rubbed off with a piece
of burlap or a handful of fine shavings or excelsior.
But it must not all be rubbed off or drawn out of
the grain. This is an easy mistake for an inexperienced
worker to make. The thing to do is to
rub it in and at the same time leave the surfaces
smooth. The surfaces should then be allowed to
dry for about twenty-four hours before receiving
the final finishing coats.</p>


<h3>VARNISHING</h3>

<p>The importance of a good foundation surface&mdash;even,
smooth, and free from unsealed pores that
would absorb and thus undermine the first coat
of varnish&mdash;has been explained in the section on
filling and surfacing. If this foundation has been
well laid, the amateur finisher may enter upon the
varnishing stage of his work with confidence; but
he will soon learn that there is much call for skill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
in order to produce the desired results in this part
of the finishing process. The selection, preparation,
and application of varnish is a special calling,
and great skill comes only as the result of experience;
but certain main facts and principles are easily
learned.</p>

<p><i>How a Good Varnish is Recognized.</i>&mdash;It is hardly
necessary to say that a superior varnish must be
clear, transparent, and brilliant. These qualities
are always associated with this kind of finish. But
durability is also a necessary quality. An expert will,
with his eyes shut, recognize a high-grade varnish
by its peculiar odour, which is to him an agreeable
one. He will at once detect inferior grades by the
rank, sharp odour of resin and benzine used in
their manufacture. The range of quality and cost
in varnishes is probably greater and more varied
than in any other finishing material. For fine,
artistic work only the best varnish is allowable;
and this may be bought for $3.00 a gallon.</p>

<p><i>"Sag" and How Corrected.</i>&mdash;A good varnish flows
easily from the brush, spreads evenly, and dries
slowly, thus allowing plenty of time for its proper
distribution over the surface. And time enough
should be taken to apply an even coat which will
not dry unequally and lead to cracking due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
irregular contraction in the process of hardening.
It is of the utmost importance that each coat be
spread evenly over the surface when first applied.
Great care should be taken not to brush long in one
place. Re-brushing after a brief interval leaves
brush marks which are objectionable. Unequal
spreading on broad surfaces often causes the varnish
to run or "sag." A tendency to sag may be
brushed out if attended to promptly. But, if it
is not noticed until the varnish has begun to set,
the only way to prevent a bad blemish is to absorb
the thickening parts of the coat by means of a partly
dried brush; and this must not be attempted three
or four minutes after the varnish has been put on.
By that time it will have become quite well set and
a sag will be beyond repairing by any simple means.</p>

<p><i>Time Required Between Varnish Coats.</i>&mdash;The best
varnishes, as has been stated, dry quite slowly,
and they seem to dry and harden not, as shellac
does, on the top first, but from the under surface
outward. This peculiarity emphasizes the need of
allowing sufficient time between coats. And it
should be added that mere drying is not all that
is required. Each coat must harden; and during
the process of hardening slight movements take
place throughout the mass of the coat until it becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
permanently set or hardened. The time
required for this permanent setting or seasoning,
as it may be called, varies with the character of
the under coat, with the temperature of the room
in which the finishing is done, and with the thickness
of the varnish coat itself. Five days is usually
thought to be a short seasoning period. As many
weeks would not be too long for the best results.
It is folly to attempt to hurry up a job of varnishing.
In the nature of the case it cannot be hurried without
yielding disastrous results. There is no other
kind of work in which "haste makes waste" with
the certainty that it does in varnishing. Great
pains must be taken with each coat. Least of all
should the under coats be slighted, for solidity and
depth in the appearance of the finished surfaces
depend upon there being plenty of evenly laid and
well hardened varnish before the final or finish coat
is applied. All this work should be done in a well-lighted
room, free from dust, and with a good supply
of fresh air, kept at an even temperature, of about
70 degrees&mdash;certainly not colder than this, since
a lower temperature prevents varnish from spreading
evenly.</p>

<p><i>Number of Coats Needed.</i>&mdash;The number of coats
of varnish required vary with the character of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
work. What is known as piano finish requires from
three to seven under coats of good elastic rubbing
varnish, each well hardened and rubbed down to give
under surfaces more even than the best brushing can
give. In addition to these under coats a final finish
coat is needed to give brilliancy and lustre.</p>

<p><i>How to Rub Down Varnish.</i>&mdash;Rubbing down
varnish is a unique and important part in the process
of finishing. The beginning of the operation consists
of long and persistent rubbing with pulverized
pumice stone mixed with oil or with water, if the
work is such that water would have no chance to
soak into the pores of the wood. Whichever liquid
is used, a rubbing pad will be found necessary.
This is a block about 4 inches square, made of thick,
loose cloth like felt or hair cloth. In use it is first
moistened in the oil or water and then dipped into
a box containing a quantity of powdered pumice.
With this the varnished surface is rubbed vigorously,
giving a circular movement to the pad in rubbing
down the broad surfaces. As the smoothing progresses,
less and less of the pumice powder is used.
Near the end of the process enough will be found
on the surface or adhering to the rubbing pad.
What remains on the surface is finally all wiped off
carefully with chamois skin, when it will be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
that the surface has been levelled down but that it
is covered with fine scratches due to the grains of
the pumice. These are removed by a second rubbing
in rotten stone and oil or water.</p>

<p><i>Dull Finish and Flat Varnish.</i>&mdash;For many purposes
good finishing requires but one under coat rubbed
down and covered with a finish coat; and this finish
coat is often not allowed to retain its natural
lustre. For furniture a dull finish is much to be
preferred. It is more durable, it harmonizes better
with its surroundings, and it is more in keeping with
the idea of simplicity and usefulness. In working
for a dull finish it is not so essential to secure depth
and evenness of surface as it is when a high lustre is
required, and therefore fewer coats are necessary.
In fact, a dull finish may be given to furniture without
any varnish at all. Two or three coats of shellac,
each well rubbed down, give a very satisfactory
result. Wax finish, to be described later, gives
beautiful effects. There are varnishes known as
flat varnishes which give a dull finish without rubbing.
They are made by dissolving beeswax in
turpentine in the proportion of two ounces of the
solid to a pint of the liquid, using moderate heat and
mixing the wax solution while warm with four times
the quantity of warm varnish. What is known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
as the old Dutch finish is obtained by using over the
proper stain one coat of wax varnish. But there is
no kind of dull finish so durable as that given by
several coats of high-grade varnish, each well rubbed
down.</p>


<h3>WAX FINISH</h3>

<p><i>How to Prepare and Apply Finishing Wax.</i>&mdash;The
simplest and at the same time one of the most
attractive methods of finishing woodwork is rubbing
it with finishing wax. This is one of the old processes
which has of late years been revived by the
arts and crafts societies and is becoming deservedly
popular. Finishing wax may be purchased ready
for use or it may be made by dissolving yellow
beeswax in turpentine in the proportion of two
parts wax and one of turpentine. To do this the
wax should be cut into small pieces or shavings,
placed in a dish, and covered with the liquid. The
solution may be hastened by heating in a water
bath; but, if a gas flame be used for heating the
water, care should be exercised to extinguish the
flame before bringing the turpentine near, on account
of the inflammable character of turpentine vapor.
This mixture, which is too thick to spread with a
brush, may be applied either hot or cold by means
of a piece of soft cloth. Soft cloths, like clean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
cheese cloth, should be used also in rubbing. The
rubbing should be continued for a considerable time,
but it is by no means so tedious a process as the
rubbing down of the several coats of varnish. Less
rubbing is required if the wax is applied hot. One
of the greatest advantages of the wax finish is that
it may be quickly applied and immediately rubbed
down, after which the furniture is ready for use.
Filling and finishing are accomplished together. It
is also easy to apply a fresh coat of wax at any
time. In fact, it is desirable to re-finish new
pieces of furniture in this way several times during
the first few months of their use, and after that about
once a year.</p>


<h3>STAINING</h3>

<p><i>Object of Staining.</i>&mdash;Up to this point the processes
of finishing considered have assumed that the
wood treated is to retain its natural colour, excepting
that it may darken with age. But it is often
desirable to give artificial colours to woodwork&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
to dye or stain it. This is done for a variety
of purposes&mdash;to reduce to one tone the different
shades of the natural colour often found in the same
kind of wood, to bring out the natural beauty of
the grain and texture, to give an entirely new colour
to the cheaper kinds of wood in imitation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
more expensive kinds, and to produce tones that
will harmonize with various colour schemes. To
accomplish this great variety of results, scores of
different kind of wood dyes or stains have been put
upon the market in almost countless shades and
tints, but they are all easily classified under three
heads. They are oil stains, water stains, or alcohol
stains.</p>

<p><i>A Perfect Stain.</i>&mdash;A perfect stain, if it could be
obtained, would be a clear, limpid liquid, free from
all solid particles or specks of colouring matter
that might clog the pores of the wood and interfere
with the absorption of the filler&mdash;so clear and
transparent that it would in no way obscure the
grain of the wood, which in many varieties is the
chief element of beauty&mdash;so limpid that it would
easily soak deep into the pores of the wood, carrying
to a considerable depth below the surface an
artificial colour which will not fade on exposure.</p>

<p><i>Water, Alcohol, and Oil Stains Compared.</i>&mdash;The
water and alcohol stains on the whole meet these
requirements better than the oil stains do. They
are clear, and without body, and they have great
penetration. But they are not free from faults.
Many of the water stains are made from aniline
dyes which are not durable. The alcohol stains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
however, are generally permanent. Both the water
stains and the alcohol stains raise the grain of the
wood and are liable to show darker in corners and
on end grains and to show laps from re-brushing.
The oil stains, on the other hand, are free from these
faults. They spread easily and evenly, they do
not raise the grain, they do not double up or show
laps or streaks, and they do not fade; but they have
a few defects which overbalance these good qualities.
They have considerable body which prevents
them from penetrating equally all parts of the
surface, so that they do not carry in the colouring
as either the water or the alcohol stains do. Their
oily nature causes them partly to close up the
filaments of the wood and thus interfere with the
subsequent process of filling. This is so bad a
defect that oil stains are not to be recommended
for open-grained woods, the fine finish of which
depends so much on correct filling. They are more
successful with the close-grained woods, which need
only to be surfaced with shellac or the ordinary
liquid filler.</p>

<p><i>How Stain is Applied.</i>&mdash;If furniture or any kind
of woodwork is to be artificially coloured, staining
is the first of the finishing operations to be attended
to. The stain should be spread upon well-cleaned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
surfaces by means of a brush, a cloth, or a sponge,
and allowed to stand for a few minutes so that it
may penetrate well into the wood. The surfaces
should then be carefully wiped off with clean, soft
cloths or cotton waste to remove any stain that may
not have soaked into the wood, and thus prevent
a streaked or painted effect. After the stained
surface is thoroughly dry, a filler, coloured to match
the stain, should be applied and rubbed well into
the pores, as already explained in the section on
natural finish. The beginner will need to be cautioned
again and again not to rub the filler all off or
draw it out of the grain, but to rub it in as much
as possible. He will also need to be on his guard
against the presence of moisture or grease, which
will interfere with good results.</p>

<p>Excellent prepared stains in great variety may
be easily obtained of dealers in painters' supplies.
They will not always produce the effects claimed
for them, but with a little experimenting it is possible
to find prepared stains that will give almost
any desired result. They are somewhat expensive,
however, and the amateur finisher may prefer to
develop his own stain. Following are some suggestions
along this line:</p>

<p><i>Asphaltum and Golden Oak Stain.</i>&mdash;A good chocolate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
brown stain may be produced on almost any
light-coloured wood by a very thin varnish made by
colouring turpentine with asphaltum and applying
with a brush. A considerable quantity of asphaltum
should be used, but not enough to make a
sticky liquid. This will need to be finished with
shellac or finishing varnish. When applied to
quartered oak it produces the beautiful effect known
as golden oak. It may also be used on white wood
to give an imitation of black walnut; and Georgia
pine under this stain takes on a very attractive tone
without obscuring the natural figure of the wood.</p>

<p><i>Mahogany.</i>&mdash;A clever imitation of mahogany may
be made by staining birch of the right grain with
logwood stain. The stain is made by boiling together
equal parts of logwood chips and water for
about three hours. While the mixture is hot,
chloride of tin is added gradually until the right
shade of colour is produced. The stain should be
allowed to cool before it is applied, and then several
coats may be needed to secure the right depth of
shade. The filler used should be coloured with
burnt umber and sienna. The finish may be a
brilliant or a flat varnish, or wax.</p>

<p><i>Baywood as Mahogany.</i>&mdash;Mahogany stain is also
applied to baywood, resulting in what commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
passes for real mahogany. The genuine article,
however, is an imported wood coming from South
America, Mexico, and Africa in several varieties;
and it is a much harder wood than the American
baywood imitation. Both the birch and the baywood
imitations of mahogany may be so well stained
and finished that it is difficult to distinguish them
from the imported varieties.</p>

<p><i>Flemish Oak.</i>&mdash;The various oak stains are worthy
of special mention. Flemish oak finish is very dark,
almost black. It is prepared by first applying a
stain made of bichromate of potash dissolved in
water in the proportion of one half pound of bichromate
to a gallon of water. The solution should
be strained and applied with a stiff brush. After
drying, the surface is well sand-papered and a coat
of thin black stain is applied, made by dissolving
japan drop-black in turpentine. This is allowed
to stand a few minutes, then wiped off, and when
the surface is thoroughly dry a coat of thin shellac
is applied. After a thorough drying and hardening
the surface is smoothed down with fine sand-paper
and finished with wax.</p>

<p><i>Mission Oak.</i>&mdash;The so-called mission oak finish
may be in several colours, but as a rule it is of a dull
gray with the flakes slightly reddish. The stain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
is made from drop-black in oil, tinged with a little
rose pink, and thinned with japan and turpentine.
The mixture should be strained through cheese
cloth and applied with a staining brush. Wax
finish is invariably used for mission oak.</p>

<p><i>Forest Green Oak.</i>&mdash;Forest green oak is among
the best of the green effects in this wood. The stain
is made by mixing two parts of chrome green with
one part of chrome yellow for the colouring material.
This is added to a mixture of three parts turpentine
and one of raw linseed oil, with a little white japan.
The resulting stain should be somewhat thinner than
linseed oil. After this has been applied to the oak
surface, rubbed in and dried, it is given a coat
of thin shellac coloured with tumeric and a
very little green aniline. This should have a wax
finish.</p>

<p><i>Gray Oak.</i>&mdash;A gray stain may be given to oak by
a solution of iron sulphate, made by dissolving a
small quantity of chemically pure crystals in water,
and giving the solution a strongly acid quality by
adding a little sulphuric acid. This solution is most
conveniently used by placing it in a box tank large
enough to contain the pieces of wood to be stained,
as they must soak in the solution until they are
thoroughly saturated. The pieces may be kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
separate by stout cords tied around them, and they
may be held under the solution by means of weights.
When taken out they should be allowed to dry before
they are rubbed down.</p>

<p><i>Weathered Oak.</i>&mdash;Weathered oak stain is made by
taking two ounces of copperas and the same quantity
of dry tannin, dissolving them separately in about
a quart of water, and when thoroughly dissolved
mixing them together. When applied to oak it
gives it the natural weathered tone with
a slight bluish cast. It may then be oiled,
shellaced and finished with a flat varnish or
wax.</p>

<p><i>Fumed Oak and Chestnut.</i>&mdash;But the most satisfactory
method of giving a brown tone to furniture
or other woodwork, is without question, by fuming
with ammonia, though this process is limited to
two woods, viz., white oak and chestnut. All
other woods, including red oak, are deficient in
tannic acid, the essential element to combine with
the ammonia gas in the production of the stain.
This method requires a fuming box of sufficient
dimensions to contain the article of furniture to
be fumed. It must be carefully constructed with
all its joints made vapour proof by pasting over
them strips of paper and covering them with shellac.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
The top or one side of the box should be
fastened with screws, so that it may be vapour proof
when the box is in use and yet easily removed.
The operation of fuming consists simply in placing
the furniture in the box with one or more shallow
pans filled with the strongest ammonia&mdash;not the
household ammonia, which is too weak&mdash;screwing
the top or cover on, and allowing the apparatus
to stand from 12 to 24 hours, according to the shade
desired. If the fuming box be provided with small
glass windows in its adjacent corners, a good
light will be thrown across the furniture so that
the development of colour may be observed without
opening the box. When the desired shade
has been obtained and the furniture removed,
it is best to give it a good wax finish which will
develop a beautiful velvety texture.</p>

<p><i>Peculiarities of Fumed Finish.</i>&mdash;It will be observed
that the toning of quartered oak by the fuming process
develops the beauty of the grain far better than
any other process of staining; and there should also
be noted the still more remarkable fact that the
contrasts of tone are the reverse of those given by
staining; <i>i. e.</i>, the parts that appear lighter in the
one case are the darker parts in the other. This
gives a certain distinction to the fumed finish and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
furnishes a means of detecting that which is not
genuine.</p>


<h3>WHITE ENAMEL</h3>

<p>A vivid and very effective finish for furniture
as well as for the trim of some rooms is white enamel.
It is used on new work and also in re-finishing old
furniture and other woodwork. In the latter case
the old finish, whatever it may be, must be removed
and the surfaces thoroughly sand-papered. But
whether the wood be old or not, a satisfactory enamel
finish cannot be produced by using the white
varnish alone, since, like all other varnishes, it is
somewhat transparent. It is necessary, first, to
coat the wood with flat white&mdash;a paint made of
white lead with some zinc oxide for hardening and
thinned with turpentine. Oil should not be used
in any part of the process. Three coats of this paint
will generally be needed to produce the right surface
for the final finish. Each of these coats should be
allowed to dry and become well hardened. Two
or three days, better still a week, should be allowed
for hardening between coats, since insufficient
hardening leads to cracks in the subsequent coats
and develops a tendency to chip off. When a surface
is ready for the enamel, only one coat of it
should be applied, and that should be given not less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
than one week to harden before it is exposed to
wear. Enamel is simply a good varnish coloured
with zinc oxide ground in varnish. It may be
thinned, if necessary, with turpentine, and it is
applied with a brush like any other varnish.</p>


<h3>PROBLEMS</h3>

<p>Problems in filling and finishing were developed
in the series of furniture making problems in <a href="#VII">Chapter
VII</a>. It is only necessary to bring forward the unfinished
work there described and apply to it the
finishing methods outlined in this chapter. Our
problems are, therefore, the following:</p>

<p><i>The Knock-down Bookcase.</i>&mdash;If made up in white
wood it may, like its original, be stained in imitation
of black walnut and waxed. It may, however,
be of oak, ash, or cherry, and finished to harmonize
with the furniture with which it is to be
used.</p>

<p><i>The Hanging Book Rack.</i>&mdash;In the design for this
rack it was suggested that it might be made of white
wood and given a white enamel finish, or of baywood
with a mahogany stain and varnish.</p>

<p><i>The Umbrella Stand.</i>&mdash;Oak was advised for this
piece of furniture. It needs to be treated with
a paste filler and given two coats of varnish, well
rubbed down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Magazine Stand.</i>&mdash;Oak was suggested for
this stand. The color will depend upon the surroundings.
Filling and varnishing will be required
if it be given a liquid stain, and wax finish if it be
fumed.</p>

<p><i>The Light Library Table.</i>&mdash;Oak was mentioned as
a very appropriate wood for this table, but some
lighter wood like ash may be used. It will be
remembered that all open-grained woods require
treatment with a paste filler before they are finished.</p>

<p><i>The Heavy Library Table.</i>&mdash;As this was designed
in the mission style, oak was chosen as the most
suitable wood. It may be given the so-called mission
oak stain and a wax finish.</p>

<p><i>The Round Centre Table.</i>&mdash;This may be made in
any of the woods commonly used for furniture,
but quartered oak was mentioned. A golden oak
finish will be found very satisfactory.</p>

<p><i>The Bookcase with Glazed Doors.</i>&mdash;This may be
made up in ash, in quartered oak, or in gum wood.
The finish will depend upon the kind of wood used
and the furniture with which it is to be associated.</p>

<p><i>The Library Desk and the Morris Chair.</i>&mdash;The
originals were made in quartered oak, fumed, and
waxed.</p>

<p><i>The Hall Clock.</i>&mdash;This may be made in quartered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
oak and given a weathered oak stain and wax
finish.</p>


<h3>RE-FINISHING OLD FURNITURE</h3>

<p>There is nothing that affords more satisfaction
to one looking for pleasing effects in household
fittings than the occasional piece of genuine old
furniture repaired and re-finished. Some of the
rare old colonial designs are of exceptional merit.
This is proved by the high prices which they often
command. These designs originated in the days
of the genuine hand crafts, before the invention
of machine-made, cheap furniture. The work of
the older designers was characterized by a certain
individuality which gave it artistic value; and the
craftsmen who worked out these designs did their
work with such care and thoroughness that what
they produced has had a lasting quality. It is
for these reasons that we find it still in existence
and so much desired.</p>

<p><i>Caution as to Repairs.</i>&mdash;In the work of renovating
old furniture, problems are met which are very
different from those which have to be considered
in the production of new work. All questions of
design are settled. There is generally enough of
the original article to show what the design was.
The problem is one of restoration; we must supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the missing parts and re-finish the whole. The first
thing to do, therefore, with any piece of genuine
antique furniture is to look it over carefully from the
point of view of the cabinet-maker, note its defects,
supply the missing or loosened parts, and mend the
breaks. It will be found that the wood is generally
exceedingly dry and brittle on account of its age,
and that it will therefore need to be handled more
carefully than new wood; and, in matching up, it
will often be found desirable to make use of parts
of other old pieces rather than to add new wood
to the old. This is especially true of veneering,
which cannot be well matched in any other way.
Old bits of veneer, on the other hand, may be so
deftly fitted into the spaces where they are needed
that the grafting is entirely obscured by subsequent
finishing.</p>

<p><i>Scraping.</i>&mdash;After the necessary repairs have been
made, the next thing to be done is to remove the
old finish. If the varnish is dry and brittle and
somewhat cracked, it may be removed by means
of a well-sharpened scraper, great care being taken,
however, not to injure the wood surface, especially
at the corners and edges. If the scraper does not
take off the varnish well at certain points, fine sand-papering
may be resorted to. It is generally wise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
also, to give the entire surface a light sand-papering
before it is cleaned up for finishing.</p>

<p><i>The Varnish Remover.</i>&mdash;It often happens, however,
that the scraper will not accomplish the desired
result. In that case the liquid varnish remover
is necessary. This may be found at the paint stores.
The best formulas for producing these varnish and
paint removers are known only to the manufacturers.
It is therefore not wise for the young finisher to
attempt to make his own remover. He should provide
himself with a can of it and a bristle brush
with which to apply it to the furniture. After
putting on a good coat he should let it remain a
few minutes and then try to scrape off the softened
finish with a putty knife. If it doesn't come off
readily, it should stand a little longer. The amount
of time required depends entirely upon the hardness
of the old finish. But in due time it will become
soft and can be very quickly and effectually removed.
A putty knife, however, will not remove it all.
After scraping off as much as possible from the
plain surfaces and from the corners, a careful washing
with turpentine or benzine will clean off what
remains. It is of the greatest importance that none
of the old varnish nor any of the varnish remover
should be permitted to remain. Either of them will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
show through the finish as stains on the broad surfaces
and collect in the corners when the new finish
is put on.</p>

<p><i>Re-finishing.</i>&mdash;The re-finishing process is much
like that described for new work, the chief exception
being that there is generally no need of filling unless
it has been found necessary to add new wood in
making the repairs. Generally speaking, the re-finishing
begins with the surfacing, which may be
done with thin shellac coloured to match the stain
of the furniture. This is sand-papered lightly
before receiving the one or more coats of finishing
varnish necessary to produce the desired effect.
Very often all that is needed is a well rubbed down
wax finish.</p>


<h3>PROBLEM: RE-FINISHING AN ANTIQUE MAHOGANY
TABLE</h3>

<p>The table with which this problem deals was
found in an old furniture shop among a large number
of pieces probably of equal antiquity but of poor
design; for all old furniture was not conceived on
beautiful lines. Much of it was quite as ugly as
some of the modern furniture. This table, however,
when separated from the rubbish which almost
concealed it, was found to have good proportions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
with simple but graceful elements designed to make
it useful as well as attractive. It was a drop-leaf
table, the leaves being cut in with a double curve
at each of the four corners. The legs were of turned
stock and fluted, terminating in brass thimbles
with casters. One leg was broken off, one of the
leaves had broken away entirely from its hinges
and the other was partly broken, the table top had
received some hard knocks, and the entire surface
was so begrimed with dust and dirt that it was with
difficulty that one could tell the kind of wood of
which the table was made. It took some imagination
to conceive the possibilities which lay in this
much abused and dilapidated old relic.</p>

<p>The first thing to do was to wipe off the dust and
dirt as well as possible with a damp sponge. The
part of the top that remained on the frame was then
removed so that the repairs could be easily made.
The broken leg was replaced by boring each of the
broken parts and setting them together with a
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch dowel, glued in. The brass tips and casters
were removed and set aside to be burnished. The
missing parts of the top were replaced by new pieces
of baywood, fitted in, glued, and stained to match
the original wood. After the necessary repairs
had been made the entire table was treated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
varnish remover and the old finish scraped off with
a putty knife. This part of the process was completed
by washing all the surfaces thoroughly with
turpentine, carefully picking out with a pointed
knife from corners, cracks, and openings of any
kind, all remnants of the old finish and of the varnish
remover. After carefully wiping off the results
of this treatment with clean cheese cloth all the
broad surfaces were then smoothed off with fine
sand-paper. It was found that the wood was well
filled, so that all it now needed was a final finishing
with wax. The transformation from the begrimed
old table found in the shop to a graceful and beautiful
article of antique furniture was complete.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Among</span> the home industries which the arts and
crafts societies have lately revived, perhaps
none invite more interest or deserve greater
honour than weaving with the hand loom. Weaving
is an ancient art. If we were to seek its origin we
should have to go back to the time when men adopted
homespun clothing in place of rude coverings made
from the skins of animals. That was a great change,
for it meant the beginning not only of the textile
industries but of civilization itself. It is no wonder
that the distaff and the loom were highly honoured
in ancient mythologies. Not less honour is due the
spinning wheels and looms of our grandmothers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
which played an important part in the early beginnings
of our own history. The New England
colonists spoke with pride of communities which
showed progress in the weaving of cloth; and this
was then largely a home industry in the hands of
honourable women. It was a work of necessity, but
not without love and devotion. Many evidences
remain in beautiful coverlets or bedspreads, in towels
of homespun flax, in durable linen sheets and table-cloths&mdash;examples
of unfailing patience, great ingenuity,
and marvellous skill&mdash;handed down from
generation to generation to their present fortunate
and proud possessors.</p>

<p><i>The Primitive Loom.</i>&mdash;In the Orient, where our
choicest rugs are made, two trees growing near
each other, some strings and pieces of bamboo,
and a few simple accessories, are all the worker requires.
This is a primitive loom. The modern
hand loom is the same in principle; and the looms
of our factories do not differ from it essentially.
While it is true that their productive power has been
enormously multiplied, this great improvement,
which was actually one of the chief causes of a great
industrial revolution, was due mainly to the inventive
genius of two men who harnessed the motive
powers of nature to the English hand looms.</p>

<div class="caption">Shuttle and bobbin</div>
</div>

<p><i>Warp and Woof.</i>&mdash;The fundamental process in
all weaving is essentially the same; and it is exceedingly
simple. It consists in passing one set of threads
between two other sets of threads which cross each
other alternately and are moved first up and then
down to allow the passage of the shuttle with its
bobbin and thread. The set of threads which cross
each other and which, by being moved up and
down, interlock the thread which is passed between
them, is known as the <i>warp</i>. The thread which
the shuttle carries across and between the warp
threads is called the <i>woof</i>. By careful selection
of materials, by skilful design in the dyeing and
arrangement of these materials, and by proper management
of the warp and woof to express the design,
the most beautiful Oriental rugs are fashioned;
and, though we may not be able to reproduce these
in our homes, very beautiful and very useful things
may be made upon the hand loom by those who have
the necessary enthusiasm and patience.</p>

<div class="caption">The reed</div>
</div>

<p><i>What the Hand Loom is.</i>&mdash;The hand loom consists
of four uprights or posts, joined on two sides at the
top and bottom by cross pieces. Attached to the
lower cross piece are two other uprights, one on each
side of the loom, bolted in such a manner as to give
free play back and forth. This is the beater.
These cross pieces are grooved on their inner edges,
and into this groove is slipped the reed, which is a
frame divided into sections by short, stiff wires,
making from 10 to 25 or more sections to the inch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
It is called a reed because it was formerly made
from reeds. The sections of the reed are called
dents, and through each one is to be threaded a single
strand of the warp. From the upper cross pieces
extend two other uprights, one on each side, to a
height of about two feet above the general framework.
They are united at the top by a round piece
called the roll, over which, near each end, are
passed cords attached to pulleys which in turn
carry other cords fastened by means of screw eyes
to inch-wide sticks extending across the width
of the loom. These sticks are in pairs and carry
cords or wires of uniform length through the centre
of each of which a thread of the warp is passed by
means of an eye in each wire, as through the dent
of the reed. This is called the harness. There
must be at least two of them, and there may be more.
Two are necessary for the simplest weaving of a
plain surface, and more than two if the work is to
be more complex, as is required for scarfs with
fancy borders, cushions, or any figured products
of the loom. Near each end of the loom are two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
rollers to which the two ends of the warp threads
are attached when the loom is set up for weaving.
These rollers are called beams. Over one of them
the woven product passes as the loom is operated,
while the other holds the unwoven warp. At the
back of the loom is still another cross piece, underneath
which pedals are fastened. These pedals
connect by chains with the harnesses in such a manner
that when the foot is placed on one of them the cords
attached to it play over the pulleys, throwing the
harness and the warp threads which it carries below
the level of the other set or sets of warp threads.
An ingenious device of cogs at the side of the loom
holds the work taut and enables the worker to let
out fresh warp and also to roll up completed work.</p>


<h3>THE PROCESS</h3>

<p><i>Preparing the Warp.</i>&mdash;When the essential parts
of the hand loom and their uses are understood,
the amateur weaver is prepared to make ready the
warp and attach it to the machine. The thread or
warp is taken from spools or cones, four threads at one
time, which constitute what is called a bout. After
determining how many threads will be required,
allowing so many threads to form one inch of the
woven cloth, the operator must decide how wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
her warp is to be and how long. With the width,
the length, and the number of threads to the inch
in mind, she proceeds to wind upon her warping
bars or frame the requisite amount until she has it
all in one great skein. In putting this upon the bars
or frames she should be very careful to cross each
bout&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, each four threads&mdash;so that one bout
shall go above and one below, in order to allow the
introduction of a pair of sticks, called lease-sticks
or leash-sticks. These attachments keep the order
of the threads so that they may be drawn into the
harness in the same order in which they are wound
on the beam.</p>

<p><i>Warping the Loom.</i>&mdash;To warp the loom the operator
loosens one end of the skein and, passing it
from the warping bars to the loom, attaches it to
the roller or beam at the back of the loom, after
carefully dividing it so that it may be evenly distributed.
At this point an attachment called a
rake is firmly fastened to the loom by cords and
a certain number of threads placed in each division.
By the aid of the lease-sticks, which are inserted,
and with the assistance of a second person to hold
the skein firm, the threads are wound upon the
beam. The rake is now removed and the worker
proceeds to set up the piece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_279.jpg" width="300" height="38" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Warping hook</div>
</div>

<p><i>Drawing in the Warp.</i>&mdash;As has already been
explained, two harnesses only will need to be
used for simple weaving. Taking the first bout of
four threads, the weaver draws the first thread
through the centre of the first loop in the first harness,
or the one to which the right-hand pedal is
attached. The next thread is put through the
centre of the first loop of the second harness, or
the one attached to the left-hand pedal. The
third is drawn through the second loop of the harness
connected with the right-hand pedal, and the fourth,
in turn, through the second loop of the harness
attached to the left-hand pedal. Great care must
be exercised that no mistakes are made; for a
single misplaced thread means that the work of
drawing in must be all done over again. A special
kind of hook is used to assist in drawing in the
warp. When the drawing in is completed properly,
the operator begins at the right-hand side of the
loom and, measuring the reed, allows one half the
width of web from the centre of the reed and draws
each thread through each dent in regular order.
When this is done it is only necessary to connect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the warp threads to the canvas of the beam by
means of heavier threads which hold the warp
out in the loom, test the work, and proceed joyously
with the weaving.</p>

<p><i>Beating Up the Woof.</i>&mdash;The weaver presses the
right-hand pedal, and every alternate thread separates
from the other, leaving a space between the
two sets of warp threads for the shuttle to be thrown
from right to left, carrying the woof threads through.
The operator then draws this thread up at the
side to make a good selvedge and brings home the
beater, thus pressing the woof into the warp. A
sheer fabric requires a light stroke of the beater, while
firm cloth requires more force. Releasing the right
pedal, the operator presses the left, which causes the
warp threads to cross, holding more firmly the woof
threads just thrown. The shuttle now passes from
left to right, carrying through another woof thread
which, in turn, is beaten up as before. So the work
goes merrily on with the throws of the shuttle alternating
from right to left and from left to right,
interspersed with the strokes of the beater.</p>

<h3>PROBLEM: MAKING A RUG</h3>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;This problem, like all others in
house decoration, involves in its initial stages

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
questions of design. Before planning the rug it
is necessary to know what use the rug is to have&mdash;whether
it is to be for a hall, a living room, a dining-room,
or a chamber, and whether it is to be used
upon hard wood floors or with a carpet. This is
a question of colours, and of materials; for the
designer must avoid too sharp contrasts in colour,
not only in the rug itself but in its relation to the
other colours with which it should harmonize,
and the materials used must not display glaring
inconsistencies of texture. Unless the beginner has
special talent as a colourist it is not wise to attempt
the introduction of too many colours in one piece
of work. If the warp is dark it is usually better to use
light or medium woof. If several shades are used
in the body of the rug, better results are obtained
by using for the border or end decoration one or
more plain colours which match or readily blend
with the principal colours of the body of the rug.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 599px;">

<div class="caption">Hand-Made Rugs</div>
<div class="capl">[Plate IX]</div>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Materials: Denim.</i>&mdash;There are many materials
suitable for rug making. Denim in moss or forest
green makes a rug fit for a queen. This should
be woven on a blue or green warp thread of carpet
size. In preparing the woof it will be necessary to
cut the denim on a true bias into strips from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch wide. The latter width is better.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
In cutting, the best method is to fold back one
corner of a square cut end along the selvedge, forming
a fold across the cloth at an angle of 45 degrees.
Crease this fold carefully and make the first cut
along the fold. With a yardstick or a straight
edge of some kind rule off lightly with a piece of
chalk or soft pencil strips of the proper width for
the succeeding cuts, taking great pains to maintain
a true bias. When a sufficient amount has been
cut, the pieces should be ravelled or fringed on each
edge by drawing them quickly through a button
hook. There is a certain knack in this, but it is
soon acquired. The fringed strips should then be
fastened together at the ends by means of overhand
stitching, trimming off neatly all projecting
corners. The moss-like effect when woven is improved
if the woof, as soon as it is prepared, is not
rolled into balls but left in suitable lengths for
filling the shuttle. A special form of shuttle without
a bobbin or spool is used for carrying the woof
cloth for rug weaving. Its simple construction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
is shown in the illustration. The woof is wound
endwise and unwound in weaving by turning the
shuttle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_286.jpg" width="400" height="95" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Shuttle for woof cloth</div>
</div>

<p>Another good material for rug making is found
in various kinds of woollen cloth. Warm, durable,
and handsome effects may be obtained by using a
gray wool with catawba or some other warm shade
of red as the end decoration, with set figures for the
body of the rug. Geometric designs, arrows, swastika,
the pine tree, and many other forms are
possible. Very dainty colours also may be combined
in rugs for chamber use. Materials for these
may be obtained from worn lawn dresses, discarded
silkaleen and mull, which work up beautifully
with one or two plain colours reserved for use in
the borders.</p>

<p><i>Combination of Blue and White.</i>&mdash;Blue and white
is always a happy combination; and exceedingly
dainty creations may be woven, to be placed perhaps
in the guest chamber, by using a woof of old
blue with a white warp, combined with white
borders and a white knotted fringe. A vine-like
effect may be obtained in the border by twisting
blue and white together in opposite ways and weaving
in a plain thread of white or blue between the
two. Another happy combination of blue and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
white results from weaving on a blue warp a woof
of white outing flannel, cut and fringed as described
for the moss rug of denim, with a border of old blue
and figures of the same colour. For a chamber or
for a bath room in white such a rug as this will
leave nothing to be desired.</p>

<p><i>A Weaving Design.</i>&mdash;It has just been said that
design in rug making is a question of colours and of
materials. It is already apparent that it is more
than that. It is largely a question of procedure in
the process of weaving. That this is so may be
shown in the following account of the making of a
blue and white rug. The thought was to produce
a rug with five stripes of blue running lengthwise,
with white figures at regular intervals through the
middle of the rug. To accomplish this result two
threads of white warp were removed from the reed
and harness every two inches for a space of ten
inches on each side, thus making what may be
called a weaving design; for the blue stripes, it will
be easily seen, had to appear to the number of
five on each side when the rug was woven. The white
figures were formed by first throwing the blue cloth
or woof through the warp by the usual throw of
the shuttle and, before beating it up, threading into
the warp white cloth in the desired pattern, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
which the woof and pattern were beaten up together.
For the pattern five threads or pieces of
white cloth were used, two of which were 6 inches
in length and three 2 inches, the two longer ones
being placed between the shorter ones as illustrated.
A space of 7 inches was left between the white
figures, the location of which was carefully determined
by counting the threads, both of warp and of
woof, so that in weaving the figures should appear
at the right place. The result of this weaving design
was a very beautiful rug.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_289.jpg" width="500" height="155" alt="" />
<div class="caption">White figure in blue rug</div>
</div>

<p><i>Another Example of Weaving Design.</i>&mdash;This feature
of rug designing is capable of indefinite expansion.
Perhaps one more example may be given.
The object was to produce a rug of medium dark
centre with an 8-inch border all around of a darker
colour. This effect was produced by first weaving
8 inches of the dark end border, which was of mixed
goods showing several dark colours contrasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
happily. Having reached the place where the
medium centre was to begin, a woof thread of this
medium colour and of the right length was joined
each time to short pieces of woof of the border colour
so that, as the weaving progressed along the length
of the centre, not only the centre colour appeared
in its proper place but 8 inches of border on each
side. When the proper length of the centre had
been woven, the rug was finished by weaving another
8 inches of the border colour. The result was a
rug of individuality and charm.</p>

<p><i>Great Variety of Material.</i>&mdash;Endless combinations
will occur to any one who becomes interested in
this captivating art. The field for colour design
is almost without limit. No material is so old and
useless as to be despised by the clever rug maker.
Old bed ticking with its blue and white stripes cut
on the bias makes a very desirable combination
when woven on a blue warp with a plain blue border.
A charming mottled effect in one instance was
produced by a yarn which was ravelled from an old
raw silk porti&egrave;re of a mahogany shade and wound
into balls with finely cut strips of tan cloth, the balls
being rewound several times. This was used as
the woof for the centre of the rug. The border
was made of a weaving thread of the unravelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
mahogany yarn, doubled several times to give
thread of a size equal to that of the tan cloth. Discarded
clothing in which the prevailing colours
are red, when made up into woof threads and woven
on a white warp, gives a charming effect which may
be strengthened or toned down by a border combination
as desired. Dyes may, of course, be used
if the colours of the weaving threads made up from
old cloths and discarded clothing are not suited
to the design that is to be worked out.</p>

<p><i>Weaving the Rug.</i>&mdash;When the design for the rug
has been thoroughly worked out, determining the
colours, materials to be used, and the method of
procedure, the warp and the woof threads should be
prepared and the warp attached to the loom, as
already explained in the discussion of the general
process of weaving. Further details of procedure
are not needed here. The thing to do is to weave
a rug as designed. The next thing to do is to
design and weave another rug, and then another and
so on. As in most crafts so in weaving, experience
is the great teacher&mdash;a teacher who demands
faithful work, who finds lessons of value in every
failure and abundant satisfaction in every success.
Some of these successes were found in the rugs
illustrated opposite <a href="#Page_252">page 252</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Rug weaving is probably the simplest of all
weaving and therefore a good problem with which
to begin. After serving a satisfactory apprenticeship
in this field the amateur will have acquired
sufficient knowledge of design and sufficient skill
in the art to pass to more difficult problems. This
will take her out into a large field of opportunity.
Porti&egrave;res, window draperies, table scarfs, bedspreads,
and covers for pillows and cushions in endless
variety will suggest themselves to the ambitious
worker. In all these, as has been seen in the case
of rug making, design is all important. The management
of the loom is much the same in all plain
weaving. What differences there are will be found,
for the most part, in the weaving designs. In the
following problems are described some of the special
features involved in the other forms of weaving.</p>


<h3>PROBLEM: PORTI&Egrave;RES AND COUCH COVERS</h3>

<p><i>Suggestions for the Design.</i>&mdash;If the loom is wide
enough these may be woven in one piece; but usually
it is necessary to weave them in sections or
breadths. In this case, of course, they must be
afterward neatly joined. The possibilities in colour
design are naturally varied. They may be woven
with a woof of plain colour contrasting with the colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
of the warp, in stripes, or with plain centres with
striped ends. Harmony of colour effects is always
to be sought. Depth and richness may sometimes
be obtained to a highly satisfactory degree by a
generous use of black. Materials may be yarns,
bits of silk or velvet, or pieces of fine, soft woollen
goods. The warp may be silk or linen or mercerized
cotton. Beautiful porti&egrave;res have been woven
by leaving out two threads of warp at regular
intervals, giving a loose and fluffy effect. Silk and
wool pieces may be used in the woof, alternating
with one or more threads of wool yarn of any desired
shade; and, if of the same colour as the warp
used, they will impart a very decided tone to the
whole product. In porti&egrave;res, the general appearance
is much improved if the woof is not beaten up
hard into the warp. The soft beating gives a resulting
texture that is more pliable and more suitable
for hanging in easy folds such as is demanded in
porti&egrave;res. Couch covers, however, which will have
to resist more wear and tear, should be beaten up
harder. In preparing the silk and wool pieces the
cloth should be cut into very fine strips, joined by
carefully lapping the ends, and, by cutting away
a part of the cloth, making the joint uniform in
size. If the material is cloth of ordinary thickness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> an inch is quite wide enough for strips. The
length of the pieces used may vary greatly, though
they may be somewhat different in colour. They
may vary all the way from a few inches to a length
long enough to weave an inch in the porti&egrave;re or cover.
This makes it very easy to secure a source of supply
for the material in saving old garments and short
pieces of cloth for the specific purpose of making
up the woof threads for these products of the loom.
Almost any household will be able to save enough
in a short time to furnish the material for a beautiful
pair of porti&egrave;res or a couch cover which will be durable
in quality, easy to clean, attractive in colour,
and satisfactory from every point of view.</p>


<h3>PROBLEM: WINDOW DRAPERIES AND CURTAINS</h3>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;Curtains of one colour or of several
are woven on the simple loom with two harnesses.
They may be of the soft cream tint, the material
for which is easily obtained and the effect of which,
in softening the light passing through them, leaves
little to be desired. But if a little colour be required,
the weaving design may be easily changed
to secure this result. One may, for example, weave
at first 7 inches of the plain cream. This will
give woven material enough for a 2-inch hem at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
bottom of the curtain and 5 inches before the
beginning of a coloured border. The border may
consist of two threads of colour alternating with
two threads of the cream, thus making a stripe of
about 7 inches in width. Following this may come
8 to 10 inches of the plain cream, followed in turn
by a narrow stripe of the same colour as the border,
3 inches wide, in turn followed by another 10 inches
of the plain cream and another narrow stripe, and
so on, alternately, until the required length of the
curtain has been woven. If desired, a top border
may be woven in, though it is well to make it somewhat
narrower than the one at the bottom&mdash;say
about 5 inches&mdash;and it must be added so that it
will show below the hem. In any case the top of the
curtain should be woven plain, allowing for hemming,
and also for shirring if a rod is to be inserted
for hanging the curtain. Vertical stripes are often
desirable in curtains, especially if the room is so
low studded as to invite the employment of every
possible means for making it seem higher. Such
stripes may be made by using two colours for the
warp&mdash;as, for example, blue and white or green
and white&mdash;with one of these colours as woof.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Importance of Selecting Good Warp.</i>&mdash;The successful
working out of this problem depends very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
largely upon the proper selection of materials.
While many things may be used for warp with a
certain degree of success, there are fine points to
be observed in weaving as in all the art-crafts,
and the real beauty of the result depends upon
giving due attention to these points. It is always
well to remember that in all weaving the warp
plays a most important part. Mercerized cotton
warp works out effectively with silk or linen woof
or with a combination of both, and retains its beauty
after being laundered many times. In the soft cream
shade it has almost the appearance of silk, at a much
less cost. But silk may often be obtained at a low
price if the weaver lives in the neighbourhood of a
silk mill. Bargains in small lots of unsalable colours
may be secured with which the weaver may do wonders;
and if the colours are not good the silk may be
dyed at small expense. Our grandmothers saved
their tea grounds for a week or more, boiled them,
and made a dye which gave a beautiful gray warp.
They were, in fact, very particular about their warping
threads. Not everything would suit them. They
learned from experience that the wearing quality
of goods is improved by having the warp stronger
and harder twisted than the filling. It was common
for them to spin a certain thread for this purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Exquisite results follow the use of a fine linen
warp in white or natural colour with linen or silk
for filling. Striking and beautiful also, in its way,
is the very coarse linen warp.</p>

<p><i>Variety in Woof Threads.</i>&mdash;A very pleasing effect
in sash curtains or in full length window draperies
is produced by weaving heavy threads alternately
with fine threads, using two shuttles or bobbins, one
holding the heavy thread and the other the fine
one. Two or more threads may be alternated in
this way as the fancy of the designer prompts;
and this style of weaving may be confined to borders,
leaving the body of the fabric plain, or the borders
may be woven of the solid, heavy threads and the
body of the curtains or draperies ribbed with the
alternate coarse and fine threads. Such curtains
are very beautiful in cream white; but colour may
be used if the colours are fast so that the curtains
may be successfully laundered.</p>


<h3>PATTERN WEAVING</h3>

<p>Before undertaking more difficult problems in
weaving it will be necessary to explain in general
two important processes. The first one is the
process of pattern weaving; the second, dyeing.
Among the heirlooms treasured by many families<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
are the beautiful blue and white coverlets or
bedspreads and the hand-woven table-cloths and
towels. No one with strong domestic tastes who
has been fortunate enough to see these products
of home industry can have failed to be charmed with
the wonderfully wrought designs and with the
quaint names by which they were once well known;
for our grandmothers designated these designs by
such names as Spring Flowers, Governor's Garden,
the Path of the Roses, Flowers of Lebanon, Ladies'
Delight, Fairies Ring, and doubtless by many more
names which have been lost. This work in pattern
design is wrought by the use not of two pedals
and harnesses, right and left, as used in the first
three problems, but by the use of several additional
harnesses.</p>

<p><i>To Be Learned by Experimenting.</i>&mdash;If the beginner
in weaving has mastered the use of the simple loom
with two harnesses it is possible to extend her knowledge
and skill to the successful operation of a pattern
weaving loom. But the procedure is too technical
and too varied to be described in detail as directions
for a practical problem for amateurs. It is
far better to experiment with a loom of this kind
under the guidance of some person competent to
point out the way step by step. Nor will it be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
possible, in a brief description of this somewhat
intricate subject, to suggest ideas for original weaving
designs to ambitious beginners who wish to take
up pattern weaving. Copies of the traditional
designs may be obtained as material for study and
practice. After a little it will be possible to make
variations and so lead to the delight of originating
simple and perhaps more elaborate new patterns.</p>

<div class="caption">A written pattern with a variety of figures woven from it</div>
</div>

<p><i>How Patterns Are Written.</i>&mdash;Complete working
directions for pattern weaving will therefore not
be attempted in this chapter; but it may be possible
to point out a few leading facts and principles which
will be of assistance to the experimenter who ventures
to take up by herself this interesting application
of the art of weaving. Patterns for this work
are plainly written out from right to left on cross section
paper, as shown in the upper part of the accompanying
illustration, each horizontal section of which
corresponds to one of the harnesses of the loom and
the pedal attached to it. If we have a four-harness
loom, as would be required for working the pattern
and weaving the figures illustrated, the right-hand
pedal and the harness connected with it, which is
the one farthest from the operator, are designated
by the number 1, and correspond to that harness
number in the pattern. Following in order, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
next three pedals and connected harnesses are
numbered 2, 3, and 4 to correspond with the same
numbers in the pattern. Turning now to the vertical
sections of the pattern, we shall find that each
one corresponds to a certain warp thread, so that
when the pattern is "drawn in"&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, when the
warp for weaving the pattern is attached to the
loom&mdash;we shall find the thread of the warp which
is to be drawn through the first loop or wire indicated
by a mark on the section of the pattern corresponding
to that warp thread and to the number of the
harness through which it is drawn. Thus, according
to the pattern shown in the illustration,
the first thread is to be drawn into the 3d harness,
the 2d thread into the 4th harness, and 3d thread
into the 3d harness, and so on alternately until we
reach the 8th thread, which is drawn into the 2d
harness; the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th threads are
drawn alternately into the 2d and 3d harnesses, and
the 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th are drawn alternately
into the 1st and 2d harnesses. This process
is now continued, as will be clearly understood
by reference to the pattern, up to and including
the 42d thread, when one drawing in of the pattern
will have been completed. A further study of the
pattern shows that the marks on lines 3 and 4 form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
a continuously alternating series; and similarly
that those on 2 and 3, 1 and 2, and 1 and 4 form also
a continuously alternating series. But these numbers,
however paired, correspond to the harnesses
into which the warp threads, indicated by the numbers
1 to 42, are drawn. It thus appears that after
we have drawn in as many warp threads as the
pattern calls for once around in the order indicated
in the pattern, we have prepared the loom for
weaving one of these patterns. We must therefore
draw in the rest of the warp threads in the same
order as those already drawn in, thus repeating
the drawing in of the pattern as many times as
required for the width of the piece to be woven.
The illustration shows two "repeats" of the pattern.</p>

<p><i>Operation of the Harnesses.</i>&mdash;Having explained
the method of drawing in the pattern, we may now
study the movement of the harnesses necessary to
guide the warp properly for the weaving of the
pattern. It has been noted that, with the pattern
under consideration, harnesses 1 and 3 hold a continuous
line of alternating warp threads, leaving
harnesses 2 and 4 to take up all the intervening
warp threads. If then the operator should throw
down pedals 1 and 3 together, and alternately 2<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
and 4 also together, the warp threads would be
crossed exactly as in plain weaving. Bringing out
a pattern in weaving must, of course, require a
variation of the pedal movement from that used
in plain weaving. Now, upon reference to the illustration
it will also be noted that in writing the pattern,
or in drawing it in, no two threads have ever
come together on the same harness. If the 1st
thread has been drawn into the 3d harness, and
the 2d thread into the 4th harness, as shown in the
pattern illustrated, the operator begins the weaving
of the pattern by throwing down the 3d and 4th
pedals together and throwing the shuttle which
carries the pattern thread. This operation is what
weavers call a "pick." Each pick of the pattern
thread is represented in the diagram (<a href="#Page_268">page 268</a>) by
a broken black line running across the pattern.
Thus the diagram of the first design shown indicates
that there are 6 throws of the shuttle alternately
over and back, or 6 picks of the pattern thread,
for each corresponding section of this design. But
between every two picks of the pattern thread
there must be a pick of the plain weave, requiring,
as has already been explained, the pressing down of
either the 1st and 3d pair of pedals together when
the shuttle is thrown from the right side, or of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the 2d and 4th if thrown from the left side. It is
evident, then, that there must be two shuttles prepared
for carrying the woof threads. One of these
is to be used for the plain weave and the other for
the pattern weave. The shuttle used for the
plain weave is usually threaded with a fine thread
of linen, though this, of course, is subject to variation
according to the design of the weaver. The
pattern weaving shuttle should carry a coarser
thread, which may be of silk, linen, wool, or mercerized
cotton.</p>

<p><i>Variations in Pattern.</i>&mdash;From the fact that a
carefully written pattern is necessary in preparing
a four-harness loom for pattern weaving, one would
naturally infer that the pattern must be closely
followed in the weaving process. And so it must
if the pattern be woven as written; but, after the
drawing in, it is by no means necessary to follow
the written pattern. As the weaving progresses
it is easy to see many variations in pattern which
may be woven upon one drawing in&mdash;patterns
so varied as to seem to hold very little relation to
each other. In fact, one of the delights of weaving
with a pattern loom is to devise ways of modifying
simple patterns, elaborating them into new weaving
designs, producing unique and sometimes very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
interesting original figures. We have only to remember
that patterns are made by the order and
number of the overshots&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, the throws of the
shuttle carrying the pattern threads&mdash;and that
the overshots in the same horizontal and vertical lines
are produced by the same pair. In the pattern illustrated
the overshots are made by 2 and 3, by 1 and 2,
by 1 and 4, or by 3 and 4, not counting 1 and 3 and 2
and 4, which are the pairs for plain weaves. We
should also remember that the last end in one overshot
is usually the first one in the next. Examples of
two variations in design that may be woven from the
original written pattern, to which we have already
referred, are illustrated in the diagram and probably
at least a dozen more variations are possible.</p>


<h3>PROBLEM: A BORDERED TABLE SCARF</h3>

<p>This problem will require the use of the four-harness
loom. The first thing to do is to procure
the written pattern for the border and draw it in.
When the drawing in is completed and the weaving
is begun, the first step in the process is to weave a
few inches of the plain cloth. In doing this, however,
we shall, of course, find that the pressing
of the right-hand and left-hand pedals as in simple
weaving will not accomplish the desired result;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
for it has already been explained that the pedals of
a four-harness loom must be worked in certain pairs
to produce a plain weave. It will be remembered
that to do plain weaving with the warp drawn in
as required by the pattern illustrated on <a href="#Page_268">page 268</a>,
it is necessary to press pedals 1 and 3 together
alternately with 2 and 4&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, both pedals of each
pair must be pressed at the same time to produce the
same effect as that produced by the alternate movements
of the right and left pedals in simple weaving.</p>

<p>When a sufficient length of plain cloth has been
woven, the written pattern for the weaving of
the border design must be faithfully consulted
and the right pairs of pedals pressed down in proper
order for the weaving of the pattern. The second
or weaving shuttle carries the bobbin, which is
filled with the colour required in the pattern. Any
changes of colour required by the design are easily
produced by inserting a new bobbin filled with the
desired colour.</p>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;A great variety of design is possible
in table scarfs. It is common to weave in a narrow
beading of whatever colour may have been chosen,
following this by a few threads of white, and this
in turn by a narrow band of the colour of the border
with some slight suggestion of the pattern, then more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
of the plain white and finally the full pattern of
the border. The centre of the table scarf is simply
a matter of plain weaving in white or possibly in
some solid colour, while the other end of the scarf
must be woven with the same border and bands
as were woven at first, but in the reverse order.</p>

<p><i>Variations in Design.</i>&mdash;One pleasing style of
decoration is found in repeating the border several
times with inch-wide spaces between. Another
variety requires a heavy border at the ends, with narrow
ones at short intervals throughout the length.
Shadow borders, so-called, are also common, and
may alternate with borders of colour or may constitute
the entire decoration. Shadow borders are
heavy borders woven in the cream or body colour
of the scarf instead of being in a contrasting shade.
In order to make them stand out well it is necessary
to use a coarser thread than is required for the
colour borders. A gray linen plain weave is often
embellished in white with delicate effect. There
is also a heavy linen thread which is good for scarf
borders. It is obtainable in dainty colours, and
the heavy thread seems to bring out the patterns
in greater perfection. Darning silks in fast colours
are also employed, but these should be woven
double in order to obtain the best effect. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
are found in the market in short lengths and in such
attractive colours as Delft blue, reseda green, pink,
and catawba. The last two colours, used with linen
in the natural shade, make a happy combination.</p>

<p>Scarfs should be woven from 20 to 24 inches wide
and about 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> yards long, unless some special use
requires that they should be of different length.
Not only do they make pleasing table covers, but
they are useful as tray cloths, and from them
charming sewing or embroidery aprons may be
fashioned by folding one end over, tying it with
ribbons, and arranging pockets to hold the work.
One scarf will make two aprons. Fancy bags are
also woven on the same general lines as scarfs,
but the width needs to be only 8 or 10 inches. These
may be woven of the pattern throughout, or they may
be striped with bands or borders. Lined with silk
and finished with ribbons or cords, they are very
much admired for embroidery and other fancy
work.</p>


<h3>DYEING</h3>

<p>In the discussion of the problem of hand weaving,
frequent reference has been made to the use of
coloured materials. While it is possible to obtain
many good colours in the market, it is much more
satisfactory to make these colours at home by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
use of the dye pot. In former times, when hand
weaving was general, there was no other way; and,
in fact, dyeing and weaving may well be considered
now, as they were then, sister arts. When the wool
was washed, carded into rolls, spun into yarn, and
again doubled and twisted, it was, generally speaking,
still necessary to treat the yarn with some permanent
dye before weaving it into cloth. One notable
exception was found in the natural gray homespun,
which was of yarn spun from the wool of both
the black and the white sheep carded together.
The modern worker with the hand loom will find
almost the same necessity as our grandmothers did
for a knowledge of the art of dyeing. Seldom will
she find at hand just the shade or colour required
by the design of the piece to be woven. Much of
the material that is worked up for the woof of rugs,
for example, will be found to be so faded or spotted
that it would poorly repay one for the labour of
weaving it up in that condition. And even the new
material, which it is often necessary to procure
for plain weaving, for pattern weaving, and for use
in borders, will often need a bath in the dye pot in
order to furnish the tone of colour needed.</p>

<p><i>Some Good Points in Dyeing.</i>&mdash;Good results in
dyeing are obtained by using the prepared dyes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the markets, mixing together more than one colour
often, after some experimenting, in order to produce
the desired shade. Instead of mixing the dye one
may, if she chooses, dye first in one colour and top
off with another. A fine permanent green is obtained
by dyeing thread or cloth a good yellow and topping
with a blue bath. Green and blue dye used
together give neither green nor blue but a blending
of both colours, which is exceedingly pleasing.
In all cases it is better to make the dye bath weak,
leaving the article to be dyed in the bath a long
time rather than to keep it a shorter time in a
stronger dye. The advantage is not only greater
permanency of colour but also greater certainty in
the result; for one can watch the process of dyeing
more easily and guard against the colours becoming
too dark. The material which remains in the dye
bath until it takes practically all the colour from it
may generally be depended upon neither to fade
nor crock.</p>

<p><i>Some Common Dyes.</i>&mdash;The dull, soft colours, made
generations ago from barks and teas with alum as
a mordant, had artistic qualities and were generally
permanent. It is well worth while to experiment
in this direction. Straw colour may be made from
the old-fashioned herb saffron; orange comes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
madder and fustic; yellow is obtained from powdered
dock root; rusty nails boiled in vinegar with a bit
of copperas give a good black dye, useful also in
freshening black yarns that have acquired a dull
or faded colour. White maple bark boiled in water
makes a fine medium brown which may be made
fast by first treating the cloth or yarn to be dyed
in it with a solution of alum. A permanent and fine
nankeen colour may be made from a pail of lye with
a piece of copperas half the size of an egg boiled in
it. In fact, nearly everything which possesses colour
may be considered a dye. Vegetable substances
are generally in themselves more permanent, but
most dyes need to be fixed or "set" by the use of
some mordant. All this will mean much experimenting,
of course, unless one is fortunate enough
to possess an old receipt book with its quaint allusions
to mordants, kettles of brass, and vessels
of pewter. The use of the prepared dyes, which
may be easily obtained with explicit directions, is
generally satisfactory and of course somewhat
easier; and yet the interest which inspires one to
cultivate the art of hand weaving leads to a desire
to master all of the arts intimately associated with
this ancient and fascinating home industry.</p>

<small>POTTERY</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
To watch a potter thumping his wet clay&mdash;<i>Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</i>
</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> boy who makes his mud pie, baking it in
the sun, and the Indian who, ages ago, coiled
clay in a basket which he burned away, are
but two widely separated links in a continuous chain;
for men of all time have found a fascination in the wet
clay that is so easily moulded and fashioned into all
manner of things of beauty and of use. And, beside
the joy of exercising the creative faculty, there has
also been the spur of a common need to inspire men
of different races, independently of each other, to
develop the primitive household arts, like pottery
and rug making, by the use of methods no less
remarkable for their similarity than for their
cleverness. The impressions that the primitive
man received from his natural surroundings were
easily expressed in the plastic mud, and it was probably
not long before he discovered that fire made
them permanent and practically indestructible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Improvement was bound to come in due time.
By washing the grosser impurities from the clay
mud through a process in which the heavier particles
settled, leaving the silt or finer clay to be poured
off, some artist of a very early time found a material
that became one of his most valuable helps in adding
to the furnishings of his tribal household. First
it was simply burned clay; but in due time enamel
or glazed work found its use in tiles for building
purposes, in grain jars, in wine jugs, in many kinds
of table ware; for the uses of ancient terra cotta
and porcelain were numerous.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="PLXI" id="PLXI"></a><img src="images/i_317.jpg" width="500" height="723" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Girls at Work on Pottery</div>
<div class="capl">[Plate XI]</div>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>The primitive arts, however, were not confined
to objects of necessary use. We find, buried with
the ruins of ancient cities, many evidences of the
potter's craft, and among them articles for decorating
the home, for personal adornment, and for religious
use, like the rings and scarabs of Egypt.
And in modern decorative art, as applied in the
household, the one final touch which gives that
indescribable charm, which it is the aim of all art
to give, is perhaps to be found in a few&mdash;a very
few&mdash;choice bits of pottery.</p>

<p>All of this use of clay, from the rude art of prehistoric
times to the finest product of modern skill,
is based on a plain scientific fact, <i>viz.</i>, that a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
quantity of water in the clay, not removable by
any ordinary means of drying, can be driven out
by intense heat so as to cause a permanent change
in the character of the clay. This water is called
the water of combination. If the clay is not heated
more than enough to dry it, a later mixing with water
restores it to its former plastic state; but clay once
burned has lost its water of combination and never
can return to its original condition.</p>

<p>Most beginners in clay modelling will expect,
perhaps in the early stages of their work, to be made
acquainted with the potter's wheel; for who has not
heard of this interesting device? It is of interest
chiefly because of its practical utility in the manufacture
of pottery; and yet no one can forget the
potter's song with which Longfellow begins his
beautiful poem Keramos, making it a text for a
sermon on the philosophy of life:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Turn, turn, my wheel! Turn round and round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a pause, without a sound;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So spins the flying world away!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This clay, well mixed with marl and sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follows the motion of my hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For some must follow, and some command,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Though all are made of clay!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Potter's Wheel Unnecessary.</i>&mdash;The potter's wheel
was used in comparatively early times and has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
been intimately associated with the art ever
since. But it requires much physical strength and
considerable skill to use it effectively; and its use
has been by no means universal. We find the
Indians of our own time and people of other races,
expert in building pottery by hand, using the
method of coiling. It seems best, therefore, to
advise beginners to adopt the simpler method and
to forego the use of the potter's wheel. The comparative
inexpensiveness of the hand method of
building is another point in its favour. The tools
required are few and simple. Inexpensive and
easy methods are favourable to the experimental
stage; and it is well for the amateur to have every
encouragement to experiment freely both with
methods for building and with designs for his
ware, keeping in mind always that the beautiful is
generally the simple and strong, not the fantastic
and complicated.</p>

<p><i>The Method of Coiling.</i>&mdash;It will be understood,
therefore, that in general the process to be followed
consists in building up the bowl or jar or whatever
the design may be by using coils of clay of the right
consistency, welding and shaping them together,
and scraping them down, if necessary, until they
are ready to receive the first firing. After this they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
may receive a coating of glaze and be fired again.
At first the beginner will find his chief interest simply
in experimenting with the building up process.</p>


<h3>MATERIALS AND TOOLS</h3>

<p>The materials and tools needed are as follows:
Clay; oil-cloth, 18 inches square; cotton cloth or
flannelette, 18 inches square; a few simple modelling
tools; a soft pencil; drawing paper; card-board, 6
ply; a plaster of paris "bat," or a piece of slate.</p>

<p><i>Clays.</i>&mdash;It will be necessary to add a word of
explanation in order that these materials and tools
may be well selected. There is a great variety in
clays, ranging from a very coarse red clay used for
flower pots to the finest white clay used for porcelain.
The latter is called kaolin and is very pure. A good
modelling clay may be obtained from dealers in school
supplies or from potteries. In some localities,
especially in the neighbourhood of brick-yards or
other clay industries, a satisfactory clay may be
easily found. But, however obtained, some experimenting
will be necessary to test its suitability.
The modelling clay is probably the least liable to
yield disappointing results.</p>

<p>The cotton cloth or flannelette is to be moistened
and used to wrap up the clay in order to keep it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
from drying too rapidly during the intervals when
it is set aside. This will not be necessary during the
early part of the process, for then it is desirable for
the clay to stiffen as rapidly as possible by natural
means.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_323.jpg" width="500" height="385" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Simple tools used in pottery</div>
</div>

<p>Of the modelling tools needed some can be whittled
from hard wood. They are not expensive, however,
and the beginner will perhaps find it well to obtain
most of them from a dealer in artists' materials.
The accompanying illustration shows some of these,
among them a very useful tool (F) with brass wire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
loops which are in turn wound with finer wire.
F and C are especially useful for scraping clay too
soft to be easily managed with smooth edges. The
thumb-like tool A is perhaps the most generally
useful of those shown here.</p>

<p>In this connection it is well to emphasize the fact
that <i>the greatest of all tools is the human thumb</i>.
Cultivate its use. Most modelling and building can
be managed with the thumb, assisted by the fingers.</p>

<p><i>The Bat and How Made.</i>&mdash;A plaster of paris bat
will be found exceedingly useful. A sheet of thin,
unsized paper serves well, however, for a surface
on which to build; but the dry plaster of the bat
absorbs the moisture of the clay at the bottom and
hastens the stiffening process. This bat can be
easily made. Take a small quantity of water (a
half pint or more according to the size of the bat
required), sift into this from the hand an equal
amount of plaster of paris, and stir it in until a little
dry plaster appears at the surface. After a little
more vigorous stirring let it rest a few minutes and
then pour it into tin pans which are 4 or 5 inches
in diameter by 1 inch deep. The pans should be
previously coated on the inside with a thick soap
solution, made by dissolving soap in hot water to
the consistency of a thick cream. The bats will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
harden in 10 or 15 minutes and may be easily
removed from the pan, ready for use.</p>


<h3>PROBLEM: A BOWL FOR FLOWERS</h3>

<p>This problem naturally divides itself into six
important steps, as follows: The design or profile;
building and shaping; decoration, if any; firing
(bisque); glazing; and firing the glaze.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_325.jpg" width="400" height="238" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Variety in dimensions</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Design or Profile.</i>&mdash;As in all problems of
decoration the first step is found in design. For
present purposes we may consider a bowl as having
a diameter as great as or greater than the height.
The bowl will be more interesting from the standpoint
of variety if there is a difference between its
height and its greatest diameter, and also between
its diameters at the top and at the bottom. The
accompanying drawing shows such differences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_326.jpg" width="500" height="340" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Suggestive profiles</div>
</div>

<p>Another example of the value of variety is to be
found in the curve of the profile. A line that is
simple but constantly changing in its degree of
curvature&mdash;as, for example, an elliptical curve&mdash;is
more pleasing than an arc of a circle, which
is sometimes called the curve of limitation. It
should be noted that a curved form, in order to be
forceful, should have some dominant curve in combination
with others which are subordinate. The
profiles illustrated in the following drawings have
this dominant element and are in no case composed
of arcs of circles. These varied, interesting, yet
simple lines&mdash;live lines as they are sometimes called&mdash;consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
in each case of only two or three elements,
are given here merely as suggestive material.
A little experimenting will show unsuspected possibilities
in strong, forceful curves, and the young
student is advised to make many experiments in
the effort to discover such possibilities. An example
of profiles to be avoided is given in Problem II,
on <a href="#Page_309">page 309</a>. That these are vase forms and not
bowl contours is immaterial. <i>A</i> is commonplace
because the two parts of the curve are too much
alike. <i>B</i> is unrestful in its three curves of nearly
equal size. If the suggestive profiles illustrated in
the foregoing drawing be turned upside down it
will be noted that very few of them seem as pleasing
as before. It will be found also that a different
ratio of height to diameter will give very different
effects with the same profile. A bowl having top
and bottom alike may, so far as design is concerned,
be classed with the pill box. We don't know which
is the top until we have spilled the pills. If attractive
pieces of pottery are found with the top and
bottom of equal diameter and with curves in themselves
objectionable, it will invariably be found that
the attractiveness consists in some beauty of glaze,
colour, or decoration which is prominent enough to
conceal the defects of form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Natural Forms.</i>&mdash;It may be well to add a word here
in regard to the imitation of natural forms in designing
the general shape of any piece of pottery; and
that word is a very brief one. Avoid them. Nature
is a great teacher in all branches of art; but in pottery
her suggestions are to be used as decorative
elements rather than for fundamental shapes. A
fish with a flower in its mouth does not seem appropriate;
but a bowl for water-lilies, while it may not
take the form of a fish, might reasonably have a fish
as an element of its decoration.</p>

<p><i>Testing Profiles.</i>&mdash;A good way to study the effect
of the profile of both sides of the bowl is to fold
the paper on which the profile is drawn vertically
through the centre and transfer the line reversed by
rubbing the back of the paper, thus giving the other
half of the drawing in exact symmetry. When
the general shape of the profile has been tested in
this way one side should be redrawn carefully;
then, with the paper folded along the centre line,
so that the pencil line falls outside, the whole form
may be cut out; and then it may be unfolded.
The next step is to begin to build up the design in
clay.</p>

<p><i>The Building.</i>&mdash;Roll out a coil of clay a little
thicker than the bottom of the bowl is to be; perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> or <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of an inch will serve, since the bottom is to
be hollowed slightly by scraping. The roll should
be uniform in diameter and rolled as little as possible,
in order that it may not become too dry.
Upon the piece of paper or the plaster bat start to
coil the roll from the centre until the desired size
is reached, then smear the rolls together, working
toward the centre. Turn the coil over and work
the other side together, truing up the circle and
making the bottom of uniform thickness. Avoid
the use of water in smoothing the coils together.
It may seem to make the work easier, but it softens
the clay and invites careless work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_329.jpg" width="400" height="222" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Manipulating the coil</div>
</div>

<p>With another coil begin to build up the sides,
making a complete circle, and, having pinched off
the ends where they meet, join them carefully.
Lay two or three coils in this fashion, pressing each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
coil firmly into place as it is laid, and smooth them
together as in the base. The process is illustrated
in the drawing. If the clay is very soft, the work
may be set aside to harden a little, while a beginning
is made upon other pieces. It is well to have two
or three pieces in the process of construction at
the same time.</p>

<p><i>Testing the Work.</i>&mdash;A template or gauge will be
needed to test the work as it progresses from the
first rough stages
to the finish. This
is made of card-board
by cutting
out an exact copy
of the profile, leaving
at the bottom
sufficient width to
insure rigidity
when the template
is held upright on
the table or bat.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_330.jpg" width="300" height="283" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A template</div>
</div>

<p>As the work goes on, if the design requires that
the form should be "brought in" toward the top,
the coil must be laid a little inside of the profile
desired, as the smoothing tends to increase the
diameter slightly. In all the building, allowance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
should be made for this enlargement. When the
coil is high enough and of the shape desired, it
should be allowed to stiffen until it is rigid enough
to handle. With the various modelling tools the
surface should then be scraped wherever it is
necessary to remove the hardened clay in order to
give a symmetrical shape to the desired profile.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_331.jpg" width="400" height="192" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Scraping a square form</div>
</div>

<p>A drawing is shown to illustrate the process of
scraping. The surface should be left smooth and
even; and this may be accomplished without water
or sponge. The flat sides of the scraping tool may
be used to polish the clay as soon as it becomes
leather hard&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, hard and stiff, but before it
begins to whiten and dry.</p>

<p>The lip or top of the bowl will require special
attention. It will probably need to be thinned
down and have all sharp edges removed. Then the
bowl should be turned upside down and the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
hollowed out to a depth of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an inch,
leaving a "foot" or rim around the outside of the
circle to give it steadiness.</p>

<p><i>The Decoration.</i>&mdash;After the bowl is complete as
to its general form, the problem of its decoration,
if there is to be any, must be solved. This may be
studied during the intervals when it is necessary
to set the bowl aside to harden. If the form and
colour are good, the bowl may possess a charm that
will not be improved by decoration. On the whole,
less decoration, rather than more, should be the
aim. The three vases illustrated at the top of
a following page are examples of pottery without
decoration. (See <a href="#Page_308">page 308</a>.)</p>

<p>Generally speaking, bowls like the one we are
building may be decorated by one of three methods:
By sinking lines or channels in its surface by means
of a sharpened, chisel-like stick (D, <a href="#Page_285">page 285</a>);
by modelling or carving the surface; or by painting
the surface with coloured "slip" or with coloured
glaze. It should be explained that "slip" is a
mixture of clay and water of the consistency of
cream; it may be coloured or uncoloured. A combination
of two or more of these methods is, of
course, possible. Examples of the first two methods
are shown in the illustrations of bowls, vases, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
tiles. A combination of the first and third methods
was used in decorating the tiles of the middle row
shown in <a href="#PLXIV">Plate XIV opposite page 316</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_335.jpg" width="500" height="198" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Spacing in decoration</div>
</div>

<p><i>Classes of Decoration.</i>&mdash;The <i>form</i> of the decoration
is simply a matter of space division, as illustrated
by two examples shown below. It is evident,
too, that decoration, so far as form is concerned,
divides itself naturally into three general classes:
(a) The horizontal band; (b) the vertical division;
(c) a combination of these two. The last will
prove to be the most common of the three. It
should be noted that an all-over pattern, which has
been left out of consideration as tending to monotony,
would commonly be a combination of both
horizontal and vertical methods of division. It
should be noted also that the presence of other than
vertical and horizontal lines in pottery decoration
does not affect the main classification. Typical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
examples of these divisions are illustrated in both
bowls and vases, as well as in the cuts A and B. It
will be seen in each case that one scheme or the
other predominates and that there are possibilities
for great variation in treatment.</p>

<p>Analyzing the patterns shown in all these illustrations,
we find that the band or horizontal scheme
offers a succession of large and small spaces, giving
variety and rhythm. In many of those patterns
showing the combination type there is a concentration
or "knotting" of the line at regular intervals,
frequently at the intersection of both horizontal
and vertical elements. This is well illustrated by
the left-hand bowl of the middle row shown in this
plate opposite <a href="#Page_294">page 294</a>. When the method of painted
decoration is employed the concentration point is
composed of mass instead of line. All this serves
to give emphasis and rhythm.</p>

<p>For subject matter in decoration natural forms
may be used as shown in the vase at the left of
the top row illustrated in <a href="#PLXIII">Plate XIII, opposite page
312</a>. Or an abstract arrangement of lines may be
employed, as shown in its nearest neighbour,
which may or may not have had its origin in a
very much conventionalized natural motif. The
essential thing to remember is that the divisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
of spaces must be varied and rhythmic and the decoration
suited to the method of application.</p>

<p><i>How the Design is Applied to the Clay.</i>&mdash;After the
design has been studied as much as possible on
paper it should be planned out on the bowl with a
soft pencil, allowing sufficient space for the incised
line or channel to be made. The clay should be
leather-hard&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, stiff but not dry. The spacing
around the circumference should be made exact,
deviating somewhat, if necessary, from the spacing
of the paper drawing. A good way to manage
this important step in the process is to measure the
circumference at the point of greatest width with
a narrow strip of paper and then to divide this
circumference by folding the paper evenly into
the number of units desired. By wrapping the
paper around the bowl again the points of division
may be transferred to the clay and then projected
upward or downward vertically to the belt that it
is desired to meet. It is necessary to make sure
that the vertical lines are true "meridians" and do
not swerve to the right or the left. In order to test
the horizontal lines, measurements may be made
from top or bottom. All of this work is best done
free-hand; for, aside from the value of the eye training
derived, hand-built pottery is seldom exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
enough to permit of a more mechanical method of
planning its decoration.</p>

<p>The drawing on the clay having been completed,
the next point is to choose the tool best fitted for
the work and carefully make the cuts, deepening
them from time to time as the work progresses.
If the design is to be worked out in line, a chisel,
like that illustrated in D (<a href="#Page_285">page 285</a>), may be
whittled from a pine stick. It is held nearly upright
and used as a scraper to cut out at first a shallow
channel. Reserve should be exercised in cutting,
because, generally speaking, there is danger of
making the design too insistent. Some of the best
designs are very subtle and quiet. Care should
be taken, however, to allow for a slight filling in of
the hollow by the glaze when it is applied.</p>

<p><i>Modelling a Decoration.</i>&mdash;If the decoration is to
be modelled it would seem wise to do it, in whole
or in part, as the work is built up; but in this case
great care will be needed to keep a firm hold on the
relief and unity of the decoration. It will be easy
to over-model the work.</p>

<p><i>How Under-glaze is Applied.</i>&mdash;For decoration with
under glaze the colours given under the head of
glazing (<a href="#Page_304">page 304</a>) are mixed in different proportions
with dry powdered clay and water to form a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
colour paste. This is painted on the "green"
or moist clay, forming a smooth and even surface.
Experience will teach the proportions of colour to
be mixed with the clay. These proportions vary
greatly with different colours. A very strong colour
like cobalt will give a deep blue if mixed in the ratio
of one part by weight of cobalt to ten parts of clay.
Colours like the oxides of iron and copper are of
medium strength, and antimony is quite weak.</p>

<p>Before the work is left to dry it would be well
to make sure that all corners and rough edges are
smoothed off as they will show light and rough
through the glaze. The use of sand-paper, however,
is not advised, though it may occasionally be used
in the emergency of an accidental roughness remaining
after the piece is dry. The aim should
be to have all clay work show something of the
plastic nature of the material out of which it is
made.</p>

<p><i>Firing.</i>&mdash;Pottery must be "bone" dry before it
is fired. A very satisfactory portable kiln for firing
may be purchased for from $34 to $175, according
to the size. The smallest size, which is illustrated
in the next drawing, will be ample for the needs
of one or two persons. If, however, the amateur
does not care to go to the expense of purchasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
a kiln, it is generally possible to find a pottery
factory in the vicinity that will undertake the firing
and perhaps the glazing.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_340.jpg" width="300" height="404" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A portable kiln</div>
</div>

<p><i>Temperature Required.</i>&mdash;Pottery is fired at a
temperature varying,
according to the
clay and the glaze
used, from approximately
1800 to 2000
degrees Fahrenheit.
Modelling clay fires
at 1958 degrees Fahrenheit,
or what is
called "cone 04."
This term comes
from the fact that
the heat is gauged
by pyrometric cones,
which can be seen
through a spy hole attached to the kiln. These
cones are graded compositions of various materials
and possess different degrees of resistance
to heat. They are usually set up in clay
in groups of three or more. When one of them
melts it bends over, as illustrated in the accompanying
drawing, which shows cone 05&mdash;the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
fusible one&mdash;completely "down," and 04 at a
point indicating that it is time to shut off the heat
from the kiln. This must be done gradually
and the kiln must be allowed to cool completely
before it is opened.
This is especially
necessary when firing the
glazes described in the
following section, which
require the same temperature
as modelling
clay. Further details
about firing and caring
for the kiln may, of
course, be learned from
descriptions accompanying the apparatus. Pottery
comes out of the first firing in the kiln a dull
porous ware and in colour either cream, buff, or
red, according to the amount of iron in the clay.
In this state it is called "bisque" or "biscuit."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_341.jpg" width="250" height="280" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Pyrometric cones</div>
</div>

<p><i>Glazing.</i>&mdash;It is necessary to bring the pottery up
to the condition of bisque before it can be glazed;
or, to speak more accurately, before it can be over-glazed;
for it has already been shown how the so-called
under-glaze is put on before the first firing.
The subject is somewhat technical, and it will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
be possible in a single chapter to take up the details
extensively. Briefly speaking, the glazes most used
for this class of work are the lead glazes&mdash;combinations
of "white lead" or carbonate of lead as a
flux with kaolin, flint, whiting, feldspar, and other
ingredients. These are supplied in powdered form
and are ground together in water by means of a mill
or a large mortar and pestle; a mortar 8 inches in
diameter will serve.</p>

<p><i>Grinding the Glaze.</i>&mdash;The grinding should continue
about an hour. It should be said, however, that
there is such a thing as grinding too fine. After
the glaze has been properly ground a small quantity
of gum tragacanth, dissolved in water, is to be
added as a binder to prevent flaking and rubbing
off in handling. It is also a good plan, though
not always necessary, to strain the glaze, as soon
as it is ground, through fine muslin. The tools and
materials needed for this work may be itemized as
follows: Lead carbonate, whiting, Canadian feldspar,
Florida kaolin, French flint, white oxide of zinc,
and various other oxides and colours noted in the
text; earthenware bowls, 10 or 12 inches in diameter,
for holding the glaze; large spoons, preferably
aluminum; agate mortar and pestle, 8 inches in
diameter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Example of Matt Glaze and Bright Glaze Mixes.</i>&mdash;Two
mixes are given below calculated to fuse at cone
04. One has a "matt" or dull velvety surface,
and the other has a "bright" or shiny surface.
The matt will be found more desirable for general
work because it harmonizes better with flowers
and foliage. The figures given below refer to units
of weight. Metric weights (grams) are most convenient
to use, but any units will serve so long as
the same one is used throughout. The matt glaze
should be of the consistency of thick cream, the
bright glaze somewhat thinner.</p>

<p>The bases itemized above are colourless and there

colouring material that will stand heat. A list of
materials with their colours when fired is given on
<a href="#Page_304">page 304</a>, together with a few typical combinations of
colours in quantity suitable to be added to the glaze

decorator will make use of these colour mixtures

<p><i>Applying the Glaze.</i>&mdash;Before applying the glaze
to the piece of pottery or bisque, the latter should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
be soaked in clear water for about five minutes or
until the air is expelled from the pores. When
this has been accomplished it should be removed
from the water and all moisture should be wiped
from its surface. The piece is then ready to be dipped
into the glaze, or to have the glaze poured over it,
if the size and shape of the piece make it more convenient
to apply the glaze in this way. It is usually
best to glaze the inside first, shaking out all the
superfluous glaze before applying the glaze to the
outside. During this process the piece must
be held firmly but by as few points of contact
as possible. These points of contact will generally
need to be touched up before it is ready for
firing.</p>

<p>It is sometimes necessary to glaze large pieces
with a brush, putting on several coats in order to
cover the surface with an even thickness. The matt
glaze requires a greater thickness than the bright
glaze in order to develop its characteristic velvety
texture. The greater thickness may be easily
secured, because it flows more slowly than the
thinner bright glaze and is less likely to drip from
the sides of the piece to which it is being applied;
but, on the other hand, it is at a disadvantage in
that it does not, in flowing slowly, correct inequalities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
of thickness so readily as the more mobile
bright glaze does. A certain thickness, however,
is essential; and if, after firing, it is found that the
glaze was put on too thin, a second coat may be
applied and the article again fired.</p>

<p><i>Firing the Glaze.</i>&mdash;Before the glazed piece is fired
the glaze should be dried and what runs down and
collects about the bottom or foot should be scraped
off. It should then be set in the kiln on a kind of
pointed tripod of hard burned clay, called the
"stilt," which prevents the glaze from sticking to
the floor or shelves of the kiln. All glazed ware
should be placed in the kiln with at least <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> an
inch of space between the pieces to prevent them
from sticking together during the fusing state of
the glaze, when it is apt to bubble or "boil."</p>

<p>The firing of glaze is a process very similar to
that employed in the production of bisque, already
described. Greater care, however, must be taken
in controlling the increase in temperature so that it
shall be even and steady&mdash;free from all sudden
flashes of heat. The cooling also should be very
gradual and, as in bisque firing, the kiln should be
allowed to get cool before it is opened. With this
second firing the pottery is finished unless it should
happen that a second coat of glaze is found to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
necessary. If only a few spots need attention,
this second coat is best applied with a brush.</p>


<h3>PROBLEM: A VASE FOR LONG STEMMED FLOWERS</h3>

<p>The tools required for making this vase are the
same as those used for the bowl, and the process of
building is much the same. The chief difference
is that it is more difficult to preserve the profile
in building because the added height and the
greater weight tend to bulge the lower part. To
meet this difficulty it will be necessary to set the
work aside quite often in order to let the lower part
harden sufficiently to support the upper part.</p>

<p><i>The Profile.</i>&mdash;In preparing the profile the same
rules hold as were applied in working up the problem
of the bowl. It will be well to remember, however,
that the curves of a vase must be treated with
greater reserve as to their lateral projection than was
necessary in the case of the bowl&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, the curve
of a vase should be enclosed within a rectangle
narrower in comparison with its height than is the
case with the curve of a bowl. The reason for this,
of course, is found in the greater height of a vase
in comparison with its diameter. The following figure
shows three typical vase forms. If these curves
be compared with those shown on <a href="#Page_288">page 288</a>, illustrating
bowl contours, it will be observed how the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
height of the vase is emphasised in the greater
restraint and subtlety of its curves. In the next
illustration we have two "horrible" examples to
which attention has already been called in the
suggestions for the design of bowls. The dotted
lines in the illustration show how these curves may
be improved if, in either A or B, one element of the
compound curve be made dominant at the expense
of the other. If at the same time the diameter be
made smaller in comparison with its height the
attractiveness of the contours will be still more improved.
Indeed, it will be a transformation from a
profile that is positively bad to one that is very good.</p>

<div class="caption">Profile to be avoided</div>
</div>

<p><i>Decoration.</i>&mdash;The problem of decoration is not
very different from that of the bowl. Here again,
however, the added height seems to call for greater
accent by means of vertical or panel divisions.
Unless this be understood there is some danger that
the larger vertical spaces will seem to offer simply
more room for horizontal bands, resulting in a
barber pole effect.</p>

<p><i>Handles.</i>&mdash;If handles or buttresses are desired,
care should be taken that they are designed as an
integral part of the vase&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, that they continue
or reinforce its lines. Two suggestions for the treatment
of the problem of handles are given in the
accompanying drawing. It will be noted how
sympathetically these handles conform to the lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of the vases to which they are attached. Handles
that give the impression of being made for another
vase should be avoided.</p>

<h3>PROBLEM: THE FERN DISH</h3>

<p>The process of building the fern dish is not essentially
different from that employed in making the
bowl described in the first problem. If the fern
dish is to be round, the coiling method may be used;
but if the dish is to be square or rectangular it is
not necessary to use this method. In place of it the
process of "piecing on" may be employed&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
one piece of soft clay may be added to another and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
the different pieces welded together as the work
proceeds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 495px;">
<img src="images/i_351.jpg" width="495" height="342" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Development of the fern dish</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Lining.</i>&mdash;The fern dish requires a separate
inner dish or lining with a hole in the bottom of it
like that in the ordinary flower pot. This feature
forms the unique part of the problem. Generally
speaking, the presence of this lining seems to call
for a little closer approach to the vertical in the
sides of the outer bowl; and yet some latitude is
allowable, as is shown in the right hand dish illustrated
in <a href="#PLXIII">Plate XIII</a> following, which is somewhat
similar in profile to that illustrated in the accompanying
drawing. This drawing shows the development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
of the problem as applied to a round fern dish.
Much freedom, however, may be used in the plan
as either the round or the rectangular fern dish
seems to give satisfaction. The half section in the
drawing shows a very narrow space between the
inner and outer bowls at the top edges. This adds
greatly to the good appearance of the completed
fern dish. The sides of the inner dish are made
vertical, since it is necessary for it to be easily
removed.</p>

<p><i>Decoration.</i>&mdash;The problem of decoration differs
very little from that discussed under the problem
of the bowl. Either the fern itself or its woodland
neighbours may easily furnish the motif. Sometimes
there is occasion for designing similar dishes
not for ferns but for other plants. Thus the smaller
square dish, illustrated in <a href="#PLXIII">Plate XIII</a> opposite, was
designed and made for the familiar "bluets," and the
subject matter for its design was found in that
flower.</p>

<p><i>Glazing.</i>&mdash;The rules already given for glazing
apply in this case, but it will be necessary to glaze
the outside fern dish only. It is well, however,
to glaze a narrow strip along the upper edge of the
inner dish; but the rest of it should be left unglazed.
It hardly needs to be added that in firing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
it is necessary to keep the inner and outer dishes
separate.</p>

<h3>PROBLEM: THE CANDLESTICK</h3>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;This problem introduces several
points in design that need to be especially emphasized.
The candlestick should be of such size that it
will easily support the average candle without putting
the user to great inconvenience in fitting it by
paring it off or melting it down. It is necessary
to provide a lip to catch the stray drops of wax that
will run down the sides of the candle; and it will be
a convenience to have this supplemented by a slight
dishing of the base if the candlestick is to be carried
about. If a handle is to be added it should seem
to be a natural outgrowth of the candlestick itself, as
was explained in the discussion of handles for vases;
and it should, at the same time, offer a place for
a firm and comfortable grasp. The accompanying
drawing shows how handles may be designed really
to form a part of the candlestick and at the same
time, by means of a sharp bend or elbow at the top, to
provide a natural place for the thumb to assist in
grasping the handle.</p>

<p>Whether the candlestick is to be high or low
depends entirely upon the use intended for it or
upon the preference of the user. Generally speaking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
a low candlestick is better for carrying about and a
high one more desirable for standing in a cabinet or on
shelf or table. It is well for some definite idea of
utility to manifest itself in the form chosen. Merely
planning a tube and a handle upon a base, without
carefully relating these three different elements
according to the requirements of use, can hardly
be called designing a candlestick.</p>

</div>

<p>The building of the candlestick is started, like
the bowl in the first problem, by coiling from the
centre, and the rim may be added in the same way.
Care should be taken, however, to attach the central
tube firmly. This may be coiled or simply modelled
from a single lump of clay. If there is to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
handle it is well to build it at the time the central
tube is built, as it is then easier to make a firm
attachment.</p>


<h3>PROBLEM: TILES</h3>

<p>The varied and extensive uses of tiles make it
difficult to limit the scope of this problem. Tiles
are used for paving,
wall facings, ceilings,
coverings for
stoves, linings and
facings for fireplaces,
rests for
flower pots and teapots,
and for various
other purposes. Tiles
figure very prominently
in the history
of art. They
are objects of interest
and study in many public buildings and
museums throughout the civilized world. But this
problem will confine itself to two of the many
varieties of tiles, <i>viz.</i>, tiles designed for bowls or
teapots and tiles used for the facing of fireplaces.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_357.jpg" width="300" height="354" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A tile frame</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Tile Frame.</i>&mdash;In building tiles a frame is used
measuring about 6 inches square by <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
thick. The strips forming the frame may be 1 inch
wide, lightly nailed together at the corners so that,
if necessary, the frame can be easily taken apart
while the clay is moist. This frame is placed on a
plaster bat or piece of paper and the clay forced
firmly into its corners and sides, working toward
the centre, until the frame is completely filled.
It is then turned over in order to make sure that the
under side of the clay is thoroughly welded together.
Care should be taken to use sufficient clay to bring
both surfaces well up to the surface of the frame,
scraping off the surplus clay with a straight
edge. While the clay is moist, one side is
chosen for the back, and this is hollowed out to
prevent warping. The hollowing may take the
form shown in the right-hand tile at the top of
<a href="#PLXIV">Plate XIV</a>, or it may be in the shape of channels
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch or more in width, separated by ridges
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of an inch wide running across the back of the
tile. Whichever method is used, the depth should
be about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> of an inch and not over <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch.
Even when the utmost precaution is taken, the tile
is very liable to warp. It should therefore be dried
slowly and with the greatest possible evenness of
exposure on both sides. The greatest help of all is
found in the use of the so-called "grog." This is made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
by grinding to a powder clay that has been fired once
and shrunk, but not glazed. It is used by mixing it
with the clay before it is moulded, in the proportion of
one part grog to three of the clay. It may be added
here that grog will be found of great assistance not
only in making tiles but in making other ware. It
will not be necessary, however, to burn clay for the
express purpose of making grog. The occasional
failures which develop at the first firing of every
batch of pottery will furnish an adequate supply.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption">Tiles</div>
<div class="capl">[Plate XIV]</div>
</div>
<hr class= "tb" />

<p><i>Decoration.</i>&mdash;When the tile is dried and shrunk
a little it may be easily taken from the frame, but
it should be allowed to get quite stiff before decoration
is applied. While the hardening process
is going on the decoration may be studied. The
three general methods of decoration considered
under the flower bowl&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, the sunken line, the
modelled surface, and the painting with under-glaze
or over-glaze&mdash;are all available for use with the
tile. If it is to be a tea tile the modelled surface
must be treated with considerable caution, otherwise
there may result an uneven surface for the teapot
to rest upon.</p>

<p><i>Firing.</i>&mdash;In giving the tile its first firing it is
safer to stand it on one edge in the kiln, but not on
the floor of the kiln, as the intense heat of the floor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
would be liable to shrink that side more than the
others. It may be supported on two stilts or it may
be placed on one of the shelves. For the glaze firing
the tile should be placed flat on the stilt.</p>

<p><i>Tea Tiles.</i>&mdash;The tiles illustrated at the top and bottom
of <a href="#PLXIV">Plate XIV</a> were designed and made to serve
as rests for a teapot, a bowl, or a vase. It will be
noticed that the centre is left free with one exception,
which is given as an interesting variation from the
general rule. The free space is an advantage in
giving relief to the design and in furnishing an even
surface for the teapot or bowl to rest upon. In
the decoration of rectangular tile forms the general
principles as to variety of measure or shape in space
divisions hold true. Emphasis should be concentrated
at the corners in order to strengthen the
design.</p>

<p><i>Fireplace Tiles.</i>&mdash;Some of the tiles illustrated in
<a href="#PLXIV">Plate XIV</a> would be entirely appropriate for facing
a border around the opening of a fireplace. This is
especially true of the middle design shown at the
top of the plate, on account of the lines which project
through the corner design nearly to the edges
of the tile. This makes it especially adapted to
repetition in a facing or border.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Decoration of Tiles.</i>&mdash;It is in the field of painted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
decoration, however, that the most attractive possibilities
in fireplace tile designs are found. The
framed tile illustrated in <a href="#PLXV">Plate XV</a> opposite&mdash;an example
of over-glaze painting&mdash;is intended for use as
a colour accent for the wall. This tile is painted in
matt glaze between raised outlines. Three similar
tiles are illustrated in the middle row in <a href="#PLXIV">Plate XIV</a>.
The right-hand one, like the framed tile of <a href="#PLXV">Plate XV</a>,
is a matt over-glaze, but the outline instead of being
raised was slightly depressed. The other two are
examples of under-glaze painting. They were painted
on moist clay, as described in the problem of the
bowl, and afterwards covered with a bright glaze.
In this case the glaze was itself coloured, thus adding
richness to the colour scheme. The repetition
in a tile facing of landscapes, designed to be complete
or nearly so, would be tiresome. It is better
so to design the entire facing that it will be made up
of a series of very simple landscape motifs, each
fairly complete in itself, but all so related to each
other as to form, when joined, a larger, somewhat
conventionalized, landscape. A treatment of this
kind lends itself to many other decorative schemes.</p>

<p>The fireplace offers a great opportunity for design,
not only in itself, but as related to the decorative
scheme of the room in which it is placed. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
should not be forgotten that it is, in a sense, the
focal centre of the room. This fact, together with
its comparatively small size, makes it possible to
give it a strong and rich note of colour, accenting
the prevailing colour scheme of the room. Tiles,
properly designed and applied, offer a rich and
varied field for charming effects in colour and
texture.</p>

<small>DECORATIVE WORK IN LEATHER, COPPER, AND OTHER
MATERIALS</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>To become an artist in dealing with tools and materials is not a matter of
choice or privilege; it is a moral necessity; for a man's heart must be in his
skill and a man's soul in his craftsmanship&mdash;<i>Hamilton Wright Mabie</i></p></div>


<h3>LEATHER WORK</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Leather work</span>, like weaving and pottery, is of
very ancient origin. The New Testament
text concerning "new wine in old bottles"
referred to bottles of leather, or wine skins. We read
of leather as having been used in still earlier times
for shields, saddles, harnesses, parts of chariots,
and as an accessory to clothing. In the middle
ages the "gentle craft of leather" was not confined
to the shoemakers' useful productions but included
much ornamental work. There were wall coverings
of leather with designs carved, or modelled, or
stamped with hot tools; seats were upholstered and
books were covered with tooled leather. Some of
this work was richly adorned with painted and gilt
figures like the celebrated Spanish leather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Why Leather is Suited to Decoration.</i>&mdash;Leather
seems, therefore, to have won the right to a high
place among the materials suited to decoration.
Its beautiful texture, the rich brown tones of its
natural colour, the ease with which it takes dyes,
and the readiness with which under proper treatment,
it receives and retains the marks of the modelling
tool, qualify it to minister to the artistic sense
no less than its durability enables it to serve the
more common uses.</p>

<p><i>Limited Decoration Desirable.</i>&mdash;The tooling of
leather is based upon the fact that, when wet, the
fibre yields readily to compression and receives
impressions that are retained after the leather is
dry. But the beauty of design depends upon the
colour and texture of the surface quite as much
as upon the figured impressions upon it. It is therefore
a good point in design not to cover the surface
so completely that the peculiar beauty of the
material itself be lost. The decorations should
be bold and rich, but the tooling should be confined
to a small part of the surface. Calf skin and cowhide
are well suited to tooling. They are supplied
in two general forms, <i>viz.</i>, the smooth,
generally as Russia calf, and the rough or split
cowhides, known as ooze. Leather may be stained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
a variety of colours by aniline dyes; but since
the natural colour of leather is brown, brownish
tones are more satisfactory than the blues, greens,
violets, grays, etc., because they seem more
sincere.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_369.jpg" width="500" height="199" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Leather-working tools</div>
</div>

<p><i>Tools.</i>&mdash;The simple tools required for tooling
leather may be purchased at small cost, or
they may be made from cheap nut picks by filing
these to shape, polishing them, and buffing
them. The illustrations show two different
tools, each double pointed. A and B are
different views of the first tool; C is the second
tool. The narrow pointed end of the first
tool is for outlining and working into corners.
The broad, flat end is for smoothing down
and for general use; the broad tool should be
used whenever possible. The round point on
the left end of C is used for outlining and transfering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the design to leather. The right hand end
of C is known as the background tool. It is cupped
out like a nail set, as indicated by the lengthwise
section just above and by the end view at the
extreme right; in fact, a nail set may be used for
the same purpose. The background tool, however,
is to be used sparingly. If used to excess, especially
on large surfaces, the result is likely to have
a mechanical and "shoppy" appearance.</p>


<h3>PROBLEMS<br /><br />
TO DESIGN AND TOOL A BELT</h3>

<p>The sizes given in the illustration on <a href="#Page_325">page 325</a> are
typical, but it is expected that in this and other problems,
dimensions will be varied to suit conditions.
When the size has been determined the leather
should be cut a little longer and wider than the
final dimensions are to be, to allow for attaching
the belt pin or buckle. The strip of leather should
be thoroughly soaked in <i>cold water</i> and then rolled
in dry cloth until the leather is dry enough for
tooling. It is essential that there should be absolute
uniformity of moisture. If on applying the
tool, water follows pressure, the leather is still
too wet. If it should get too dry to retain the
mark of the tool it may be sponged on the back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
There is danger of water stains, however, if the
entire back is not wet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_371.jpg" width="500" height="221" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Two belt designs</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;The illustration shows two treatments.
An interlaced pattern is shown in A which
concentrates the interest at the ends and in the
middle of the back. The pattern shown is tooled
solid and the background is left untooled. If the
pattern be tooled in outline it is well to shade these
outlines out into the background in order to give
relief to the interlaced bands.</p>

<p>Modelled natural forms are shown in B. In
this the background is tooled down, but is heaviest
at the ends or in the spaces against the raised
forms. This gives the background a richer appearance
than it has when tooled absolutely flat.
Both patterns here shown are straight with parallel
sides. Other shapes are possible&mdash;for example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
those wider in the middle and tapering toward
the ends.</p>

<p>When a satisfactory design has been worked
out and drawn it is transferred to thin bond paper.
The greatest care should be taken not to have any
pencil marks on the back of this paper, for they
leave a dirty gray stain on the leather which is
difficult to remove. It may be added here that
whenever it is desired to mark the leather for any
purpose a tool should be used, not a pencil.</p>

<p><i>The Process.</i>&mdash;As soon as the leather has dried
just enough to retain the marks, the pattern should
be placed upon it, pencilled side up, allowance
being made for trimming to the desired width.
The paper may be held in position by thumb tacks,
which must not, however, pass through the leather
inside the part that is to be cut off. The pattern
may now be traced through the paper, over the
lines of the drawing, with the round pointed tool.
Care will have to be exercised to make sure that
the pattern is completely transferred to the leather.
When this is accomplished the pattern should be removed
and the lines, which will be found somewhat
dimly traced on the leather, should be immediately
deepened by going over them with the
same tool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_373.jpg" width="250" height="202" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Method of using the broad tool</div>
</div>

<p>The next step is to tool down the design; and
in doing this the work should be turned under
the tool rather than the tool itself on the work,
in order that the pressure of the tool may be applied
at the edge of the pattern farthest from the
hand. This not only insures a correct and convenient
position of the tool, but allows a perfect
view of the work. In this part of the process the
broad tool should be used, moved sidewise, as shown
by the direction of the arrow
in the accompanying
cut. In working up into
corners the narrow tool
may be used if necessary.
The movement may be
described as "ironing the
leather down." The surface
should not be roughed up or cut up into
"shoulders." It is a process requiring time.
One should not try to get the full depth with the
first pressure of the tool. One should coax the
surface and add pressure with each succeeding
stroke, taking care that the tool does not scrape.
It should glide; and yet, on the other hand, beginners
will perhaps need to be cautioned not
to wear out the surface by feeble scratching and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
patting. A firm, even gliding pressure does the
work. As the leather dries it will be seen that the
tooling has given it a dark, glossy surface. When
the process is completed the belt may be trimmed
down with a firm, sure cut of the knife, using a
straight edge wherever straight lines are desired.</p>


<h3>TO DESIGN AND TOOL A MAT</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_374.jpg" width="500" height="190" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Supported and unsupported circles</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Design and the Process.</i>&mdash;The purpose for
which a mat is used requires as one condition of
design that there should be a plain surface in the
middle. If the general form be square the design
at the corners should be strengthened. If circular,
the design should be so arranged that it will lend
support to the perfect curves of the circle rather
than weaken them. In the three outlines given
below, C shows a form supporting the circle; D
and E show forms tending to weaken the circle.
Conditions determining size are more variable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
in this problem than in others, because of the
great variety of uses which a mat may serve. In
a design like that shown in A of the accompanying
illustration, the portions left untooled&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
the leaves and fruit&mdash;may be raised still more
by pressing out the leather from the back by means
of a tool. To do this the leather should be placed
face down in the palm of the hand or on modelling
wax, which has been covered with a piece of chamois
or sheepskin. Then by gently forcing the leather
down with a round, blunt tool such as the blunt
end of a nut pick the desired relief in the figure
may be obtained. After this is done it will probably
be necessary to turn the mat over and correct
the modelling. In order to preserve the higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
relief it is well to back it up with cotton batting,
soaked in paste, and finally to cover the entire
back with a lining of silk or leather.</p>

<h3>TO DESIGN AND TOOL A PEN WIPER</h3>

<p>A pen wiper consists of a cover, which in this
case must be made of leather suitable for tooling,
and several leaves of soft material like sheepskin or
chamois, which should match the cover in colour.
The process of tooling the pen wiper does not differ
essentially from that already employed in the foregoing
problems. It should, of course, be carried
through to completion before the book is made up.
These parts are to be tied together with knots of
sheepskin thongs of the same colour.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_376.jpg" width="500" height="130" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Steps in tying a knot</div>
</div>

<p>The series of cuts given below show the progressive
steps in forming the knot, which should finally
take the shape of Figure 5. After it has been
formed the thongs are passed through holes punched
in the cover and leaves of the pen wiper, and
secured by a second knot formed on the back, resembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Figure 4 with the ends cut as close as will
leave them securely tied.</p>

<div class="caption">Two designs for pen wipers</div>
</div>

<p>Another illustration gives two suggestions for
the design: A, a rectangular pen wiper tied with
two knots at the end; B, a circular pen wiper tied
with one knot in the middle. In these designs,
and indeed in all others, decoration should recognize
(not antagonize!) the outer form of the article
to which it is applied. This point is made in the
illustration.</p>


<h3>TO MAKE A SLIP COVER FOR A NOTE-BOOK FILLER</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_378.jpg" width="500" height="664" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Design for slip cover</div>
</div>

<p><i>Planning the Cover.</i>&mdash;The object in this problem
is to make a permanent protection for fillers. It
is well known that the fillers themselves may be
purchased for a trifling sum and that they are provided
with a backing of stiff paper which is designed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
to be slipped into a pocket in the back of a leather
cover and thus form a neat pocket note-book. It
is evident that the dimensions of the filler determine
the size of the cover; but, in planning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
cover, care should be exercised to allow sufficient
play for width, length, and thickness after all the
cutting and sewing are done. This means that
the stock for the cover and lining should be cut a
little larger than called for in the final size. The
design illustrated shows both the outside (A) and
the inside (B) of the cover. As it is planned the
cover is to be lined with sheepskin of harmonizing
colour; but this may be left out if desired, though
it, of course, gives a much better finish to put
it in.</p>

<p><i>Assembling the Parts.</i>&mdash;The first step after cutting
out the leather for the cover is to prepare the
leather and tool it, if it is to have any decoration.
A piece of leather should be cut for the pocket, and
the edge (C) shaped. The edges of the lining and
the pocket should next be lightly pasted and pressed
on the cover. A line is then to be ruled with a
leather tool (not with pencil) on the outside to
serve as a guide for stitching. A machine stitch
may be employed or it may be done by hand. If
by the latter method it will be necessary to pierce
the leather at equal distances along the tooled
line. Hand stitches may safely be a little longer
than the machine stitches.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_380.jpg" width="500" height="280" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Stitching with two needles</div>
</div>

<p><i>Stitching.</i>&mdash;A good way to secure equally spaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
stitches by hand sewing is to make use of bow
springs or spacing dividers set to the required
distance. A more rapid way to accomplish the
same thing is possible by making use of a tracing
wheel, if one is available of suitable size and of the
right spacing between the teeth. The hand stitching
may be done either with one needle or with
two. If with one it is best to sew a running stitch
once around the seam and then return, covering
the alternate spaces left on the first round. It is
better, however, to use two needles, one on each
end of one thread, selected long enough to finish
the sewing without piecing it, and to proceed as
illustrated in A and B, <i>i. e.</i>, to draw one needle
with its thread through to the middle of the thread,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
as shown in A, and then the other through the next
hole, and so on alternately from opposite directions,
producing a stitch like that illustrated in
B. It will, of course, be understood that, in the
illustration, the length of the stitch is exaggerated
in order to show the process plainly.</p>

<p><i>Trimming and Finishing.</i>&mdash;When the sewing is
finished the thread is fastened by doubling over
one or two of the stitches and drawing the ends
inside between the cover and lining. Then a line
should be tooled on the cover about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> of an inch
outside of the stitching, and on this line the cover,
lining and pocket are trimmed together. The raw
edges may be treated with water colour to give them
a finish. Finally the cover is moistened a little and
folded back with firm pressure in order to establish
an even and permanent bend in the leather.</p>


<h3>TO DESIGN AND MAKE A DESK PAD</h3>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;The problem of design in this case is,
first of all, to determine the dimensions of the pad,
which depend, of course, upon the use to be made of
it. Then a dimensioned sketch should be drawn
in outline, including the spacing for the corners
as illustrated in the drawing (A). The only detail
that will need elaboration is the corner. The shape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
and decoration of one of the corners should be carefully
laid out on thin paper, from which in due time
it may be transferred to the leather and tooled as in
other problems.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption">Detail of the leather corner(left) Outline of desk pad(right)</div>
</div>

<p><i>Material and the Process.</i>&mdash;For making the pad
it will be necessary to secure a piece of binders'
board&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, heavy pulp or straw board&mdash;of the
required size. The medium weight is the best,
and it may generally be obtained at the bookbinder's.
If this cannot be obtained, two sheets
of 10-ply card-board may be used instead. The
size given in the drawing will carry a half sheet
of commercial blotting paper. The edges of the
paper board should be bound with passe-partout
binding of a colour to harmonize with the leather
that is to be used; the strips of binding should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
be long enough to extend under the leather corners
but they need not reach up to the corners
of the board. After the binding has been put on,
the top of the board should be covered with paper
also harmonizing in colour with the leather, and
the paper should be cut of such size as to lap
over the edge of the binding and yet leave a suitable
width of the binding. The so-called "cover papers"
will be found satisfactory.</p>

<p><i>Making the Corners.</i>&mdash;The next step in the process
is to lay out and cut the leather corners
according to the original design. The form in
which the leather is to be cut and the dimensions
are shown in the illustration B. The little
flap at <i>x</i> should be noted. It is designed to
tuck under and close the corner. The edges of
leather at <i>x</i> should be "skived" or thinned down
so as to add to the neat appearance of the work.
Further improvement will result from skiving
down the edges S R S and T V T of the large
flaps, which are to be folded over underneath
and pasted down to the back of the board. The
ordinary photographers' paste is satisfactory for
this work. When the leather corners are placed
in position for pasting, two or three thicknesses
of blotting paper should be used at each corner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
in order to secure the necessary space for the reception
of the blotters when the board is in use.
After the corners are pasted on, the back of the
board should be covered with paper in the same
way as the front, care being taken to leave a portion
of the binding and leather exposed. Finally a
number of blotters of full size should be inserted
in position under the corners to keep them in shape
and the whole placed under light pressure until dry.</p>


<h3>TO DESIGN AND MAKE A CARD-CASE</h3>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;In the illustration (A), showing
a card-case unfolded, the dimensions give the finished
size. The same card-case is illustrated in
B somewhat reduced in scale and with the flaps
turned in. The design on A is a rectangle broken
at the corners. In this case, as it may be with all
similar forms, the design is treated as a sort of
binding, extending across the middle fold. C
shows an alternative design which is treated as a
panel and may be placed on one or on both sides
of the card-case. The question of which is the top
and bottom in such a design as that in C can
be determined only by the owner's habit of holding
a case. Sometimes a monogram is placed in one
of the inner flaps, as illustrated in A, or on one of
the outer surfaces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_385.jpg" width="500" height="397" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Design for a card-case</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Process.</i>&mdash;In cutting the leather for a card-case
it is necessary to provide a piece a little
larger than the finished dimensions in order to
allow for trimming. The design should be transferred,
the line of stitching determined, and the
tooling done, according to the description already
given for the other problems.</p>

<p><i>The Lining.</i>&mdash;A card-case may be lined either
with silk or with sheepskin, in a colour to harmonize
with the outside. If lined with silk it
must be trimmed down to size accurately after tooling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
great care being exercised to have the sides
parallel and the corners true and square. Then the
silk is to be turned in at the edges and lightly pasted
along the edges to a width of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an inch, care
being taken, however, not to paste those portions of
the edges that will be visible when the flaps of
the cover are turned in, <i>i. e.</i>, the middle of
the fold B. This precaution should be taken
because the paste may strike through and
spot the lining. The flaps should then be
moistened a little and folded down with firm pressure;
but before stitching they should be fastened
down with a little paste to form pockets. This
takes the place of basting and is followed by stitching
as described in the problem of the note-book.
If lined with sheepskin, the ooze side showing,
the cover need not be trimmed down until after
the stitching; then both may be trimmed at once.</p>


<h3>TO MAKE A LEATHER PURSE</h3>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;The details of design and construction
are shown in the accompanying illustrations. In A
the outer flap is shown tooled. It will be noticed
that the cap of the snap fastener is taken as the
central point in design. The tooling is done as
directed in the other examples of this class of work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_387.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Design for a purse</div>
</div>

<p>The purse is lined throughout with leather.
It has bellows ends, as shown in the perspective
at C and in the end view at B. The pattern of
the bellows end shown in D is intended to fold in
the middle, bringing both ends of the leather together
and thus giving an end of double thickness.
With thin leather, such as is used in the present
instance, this pattern is practicable. If thicker
leather be used the bellows must be made of single
thickness. In this case the pattern would simply
be like that shown in the lower half of D.</p>

<p><i>The Process.</i>&mdash;After the lining is pasted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
cover a snap fastener should be attached. Proper
care, of course, should be taken to see that the fastener
comes in the right place so that the purse will
fold properly. The cover and lining should then be
trimmed and the leather surface ruled for stitching.
It is well to fold the inner flap of the purse while it is
moist from pasting. Finally a little paste is applied
along the edges of the bellows ends and they are
placed in position.</p>

<p>Stitching is started at the point E shown in the
perspective. Hand stitching is the most practicable.
The direction is down one side, up the other,
and around the outside flap to the other bellows
end, stopping at the point F. When the stitching
is completed the inside flap should be folded down.</p>


<h3>TO MAKE A LIMP LEATHER BOOK COVER</h3>

<p><i>The Design.</i>&mdash;The first step is to choose the book
to be bound. For the sake of simplicity, as perhaps
the first piece of bookbinding undertaken,
it should be a folio or "section." And it should
be <i>worth binding in leather</i>. The subject, the
paper, and the typography should be worthy of
the distinction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_389.jpg" width="500" height="707" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Typical arrangements suitable for tooled leather covers of books. Details
of tooling, relief, etc., worked out as in other problems.</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Process.</i>&mdash;If the book selected is already
bound or "cased" it is necessary first to remove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
the binding or casing. Then at least three fly
leaves should be added, made up to match the
other leaves of the folio. A piece of bookbinders'
linen or buckram is now cut to the size of the open
folio, placed upon it like a cover, and, with the
fly leaves and the folio itself, stitched through
the back with silk of a colour to harmonize with
the leather.</p>

<p>The next step is to prepare the leather cover.
To do this, first place the leather in position
on the closed folio and, allowing <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch
at the top and bottom and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an inch at the
fore edge, mark and cut out the stock for the
cover. The decoration, if there is to be any, may
now be tooled on. If the design is heavy enough in
relief to need a backing, it may be at once filled
with cotton batting, pasted in as directed in the
problem of the mat, and covered with thin paper.</p>

<p>Stock for the end papers is now selected. They
may be of cover paper, or of silk, and they should
harmonize in colour with the leather. They are
formed of two thicknesses of the material chosen,
by folding it over to fit into the part between the
linen and the first fly leaf. If of paper they are
to be cut to the length of the folio leaves, but the
width is to be left with an allowance for adjustment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
after the linen is pasted in. If the end leaves
are to be of silk, an allowance of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch
must be left for turning in at the top, the bottom
and the fore edge.</p>

<p>We are now ready to paste the linen to the leather.
Strong paste, with perhaps a little thin glue added,
is needed for this part of the process. Now paste
the outside end leaves to the linen on the inside
of the cover; and, if silk has been used for these
leaves, paste the other two to the outer fly leaves.
Finally, the book should be placed under very
gentle pressure and kept in this condition until
dry. Care should be exercised to adjust this pressure
to the character of the tooling, if there is any,
so as not to crush it.</p>


<h3>COPPER WORK</h3>

<p>There is a limited field for metal work in home
decoration; but there are some things of metal
that combine beauty and utility to a remarkable
degree and, in their making, introduce us to most
interesting operations. Beginning with the gate,
which may be of wrought iron, or with the door
knocker, which may be of antique brass, we may
find in every home problems of design involving
work in metals. Ornamental hinges, key<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
escutcheons, fastenings of various kinds, andirons,
and other accessories of the hearth, lamp holders, card
trays, crumb trays, bon bon dishes, and many other
useful things that may be made in attractive forms
readily suggest themselves. How some of these
may be made is suggested in the following simple
problems:</p>


<h3>TO MAKE A LETTER RACK</h3>

<p>This is an easy problem. Only four constructive
operations are required, <i>viz.</i>, cutting out the stock,
sawing the design,
bending, and finishing.
The illustration shows
the form and the dimensions
and suggests a
simple design. The
material required is 18-gauge
soft copper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_392.jpg" width="300" height="319" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Design for a letter rack</div>
</div>

<p>The first step in the
process is to cut out a
strip of copper 8 inches
long and 4 inches wide.
If necessary the edges may be trimmed even and
then the round corners should be cut. The design is
traced on strong, thin paper and securely pasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
on the copper in the proper position by using cold
liquid glue. A hole is drilled through each unit
of the design by means of a hand drill, a jewellers'
saw inserted, and the design cut. Time and patience
will be required for this operation. Saws
are easily broken, and new ones must be attached
to the saw frame and again applied to the work.
After sawing the design it is necessary to give
the edges a smooth finish. This is done with a
file. The surface which is to form the inside of
the rack is then thoroughly cleaned and polished
with water and pumice.</p>

<p>The copper is now ready to be bent to the required
shape. To do this prepare a block of hard
wood 8 inches long and 2 inches wide, grip it in a
bench vise, and clamp the strip of copper squarely
across the block in such a position that the sides may
be bent over the edges of the block. When this has
been done it only remains to clean the outside surface
and finish it on the felt buffing wheel. If a
fine polish is desired, the buffing should be preceded
by careful grinding with a Scotch water stone and
water.</p>


<h3>TO MAKE A LETTER OPENER</h3>

<p>This requires the same kind of material as the
letter rack and the same operations, with the addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
of riveting. After the stock is cut out, trimmed and
trued up at the edges, an outline of the design is
pasted on, as in the previous problem, and the design
cut out. The top is then bent over and riveted with a
copper tack, having shaped the head of the tack in
the vise before inserting it. While the tack is being
riveted the finished head should be protected by
placing it on a lead block. Finally the edge should
be filed to the shape shown in the cross section, and
the whole cleaned and polished.</p>

<div class="caption">Design for a letter opener</div>
</div>


<h3>TO MAKE A HAT PIN</h3>

<p>For this problem 12-gauge copper will be needed.
The operations required are cutting out, sawing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
soft soldering. After the necessary stock has been cut
to the required shape and the edges filed, the design is
outlined, pasted on, sawed, and finished as before. It
is desirable to grind with the Scotch stone and water
to a good polish. The head will then be ready to be
attached to the pin.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_395.jpg" width="350" height="288" alt="" />
<div class="caption">The hat pin</div>
</div>

<p>Carefully scrape with a knife the portions of the
surface where
the pin is to be attached
(shown in
the drawing), select
a steel pin of
desired length,
scrape the surface
of the little
disk attached to
one end of it, apply
to this disk
a little soldering paste by means of a small stick, and
then, with a gas (or alcohol) blowpipe, melt on a bit
of soft solder, which should cover the whole disk.
Now place the copper, outside face down, on an
asbestos pad, applying the soldering paste to the
central portion, place the disk with its bit of solder
on this portion of the copper, and fuse as before.</p>

<p>When the copper has cooled, clean off the oxide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
which will have formed, by dipping in diluted sulphuric
acid, and polish on the buffing wheel.</p>


<h3>TO MAKE A BELT PIN</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_396.jpg" width="350" height="301" alt="" />
<div class="caption">The belt pin</div>
</div>

<p>Eighteen-gauge copper is required for this problem.
The operations are like those for the hat pin except
that hard soldering is necessary. The slight bending
of the copper, required in this case, is done by means
of a horn mallet and a sand pad. For hard soldering,
the surface must be scraped as before and covered
with a little borax ground in water and applied
with a small brush. The belt plate should then
be placed on the asbestos pad, with its convex
face down, and blocked up so that the end where
the soldering is to be done is horizontal. The catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
should then be placed in position with a small
piece of silver solder at the base. The solder should
be melted as before by means of a mouth blowpipe
and gas or alcohol flame. The hinge is soldered on
in the same way, and finally the pin is cleaned and
polished for use.</p>


<h3>TO MAKE A SET OF BOOK ENDS</h3>

<p>This problem is much like the first one described
under metal work. Sixteen-gauge copper is required.
It may be bent by placing it between two hard wood
blocks in a vise and hammering it with a rawhide
mallet.</p>

<h3>TO MAKE A TEAPOT STAND</h3>

<div class="caption">Design for a teapot stand</div>

<img src="images/i_399.jpg" width="300" height="282" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Detail of a corner</div>
</div>

<p>Twenty-gauge copper is required for this problem.
The operations are similar to those already described;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
but the cutting and bending are much more difficult.
After determining the design it will be necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
make a drawing showing fully developed surfaces, as
illustrated in the detail of the corner. The four
corners must be marked and cut exactly as shown
in the drawing. A piece of hard wood is then cut
to the size of the top, 5 inches square in this case,
to be used as a form on which to bend down the
sides and turn the
flanges. If the corners
are correctly cut the
parts will fall naturally
into place, to be bored
and riveted, as the
drawing plainly shows.
In order to protect the
tablecloth, the under
side of the rivet holes
should be countersunk so that the ends of the rivets
may be finished smooth and flush with the under
surface. As an additional protection, a felt mat
may be glued on the bottom.</p>


<h3>TO MAKE A WATCH FOB</h3>

<p>This problem introduces engraving and enamelling,
two interesting but somewhat difficult operations.
The process to be carried out is as follows: Using 12-gauge
copper, saw the outline, and apply the design<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
for the part to be enamelled to the copper by sketching
it with a pencil or transferring it by means of
carbon paper. Then strengthen the pencil or carbon
lines by scratching lightly with a scratch awl.
Imbed this fob in pitch, either in a pitch bowl
or in a small quantity of pitch placed on a piece
of board clamped to the
bench or table. Using
an engraving tool, remove
the copper from the spot
to be enamelled to the
depth of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub> of an inch.
It is well to have the bottom
of the spot reasonably
level but not necessarily
smooth and the sides
slightly undercut. Before applying the flux, clean,
by pouring a small quantity of concentrated nitric
acid over the cut and immediately rinsing it off
under the water tap. Flux should be kept in a
closed jar under water after grinding, and taken
out as needed on the tip of a small strip of copper
previously cleaned with acid. Enough flux should
be applied to cover the bottom of the spot to be
enamelled; but the depth of the spot must not
be filled up.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_400.jpg" width="250" height="258" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Design for a watch fob</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>Now place the fob on a piece of wire gauze on
an iron tripod, and apply the flame of the blowpipe
to the under side. Heat very slowly until all the
water is driven off, then force the heat until the
flux is fused. Allow it to cool slowly, then remove
any flux that may have adhered to the surface
of the fob by grinding with Scotch stone.
Clean with acid as before, fill the spot with enamel
in the same manner as the flux was applied, and
fuse again. After fusing, the surface should be
stoned again to remove inequalities and again
fused, cleaned with water and buffed on the wheel.</p>

<p>If it is desired to apply enamel to sterling silver
the flux may be omitted and the enamel applied
directly, but the silver should be cleaned with
sulphuric acid instead of nitric acid, and great
care should be used in heating as the fusing point
of silver is but little above that of enamel. The
depth of the engraving on the silver need not be
as great as on the copper.</p>


<h3>TO MAKE A CARD TRAY</h3>

<p>Eighteen-gauge copper should be used for this problem,
and two new operations, <i>viz.</i>, raising and chasing,
are introduced. After cutting out a circular piece of
copper to the diameter indicated, allowing one half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
an inch extra for raising, it is annealed by heating it
to red heat under the blowpipe flame and cooling
by dipping in a sulphuric acid pickle bath. A
circle indicating the inner edge of the rim is lightly
scratched, and a hard wood block is cut on the
end grain to the shape indicated in the sketch,
and placed in a vise. Now holding the copper
on the block, it is raised to shape with the round
end of the roughing hammer. It is well to anneal
frequently.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_402.jpg" width="400" height="472" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Design for a card tray</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>After shaping, the design may be applied
by means of transfer paper and the lines lightly
scratched on the surface. Then imbed the tray
in pitch and outline the design by following the
lines with a narrow chasing tool. Reverse the tray
on the pitch and, with a chasing tool of suitable
shape, raise the body of the design to the height
desired. Reverse on the pitch again and with a
flat tool true the outlines and smooth the background.
Remove from the pitch, trim the edge
of the tray if it is forced out of line, clean with
pumice stone and buff.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 247px;">
<img src="images/i_403.jpg" width="247" height="246" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Method of shaping with the hammer</div>
</div>

<p>All the foregoing articles may be agreeably coloured
by painting them with, or immersing them
in, a weak solution (boiling) of liver of sulphur. If
soft solder has not been used, another pleasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
finish may be secured by applying a thin coat of
lubricating oil and heating gently until the oil is
volatilized. An antique green or verdigris finish
may be obtained by painting with a mixture of
acetic acid and copper carbonate. Several coats
may be necessary; and it is desirable to lacquer
the surface to ensure permanency.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Work in Other Materials</span><br /><br />
A CANDLE SHADE</h3>

<p>The materials and tools for this problem are
six ply card-board in dull shades of gray, brown
or green, and with mat surface; Japanese paper
of average thickness; passe-partout binding a
little darker than the card-board and of harmonizing
colour; paste; a penknife with a thin blade;
and a water colour outfit.</p>

<p>Of the drawings included in the group on the
opposite page one shows a development of the
surface of the candle shade which is the subject
of this problem. Referring to the elevation it will
be seen that if the edges AE and DH be continued
until they meet at O, OE and OH are really equal
to the radii of the outer arc of the development
shown in the upper part of the group, and OA and
OD, to the radii of the inner arc. This upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
developed surface really forms the pattern of the
candle shade.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_405.jpg" width="500" height="741" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Details of candle shade</div>
</div>

<p>The decoration consists of openings cut through
the card-board segments. These are covered with
Japanese paper, thus allowing light to pass through,
but adding the effect of colour. A margin of
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an inch is allowed along the openings, the
remaining spaces being divided by partitions of
card-board, as shown in the different typical designs
at the right of the illustration. It will be noticed that
the group of openings forming the decoration of
one side conforms in the main to the shape of that
side. It will also be noticed that there is a variety
of size and shape in the openings, but that they
all show a certain unity and harmony of space
division.</p>

<p>The openings are cut with a penknife, care
being taken to make as clean a cut as possible.
Japanese paper, of pale green, orange, or some
suitable light colour, is pasted under the openings.
The process of pasting is one that requires some
care. It is well to paste only a portion of the pasteboard
at a time taking care not to use more
paste than necessary and not to let any get over the
edges of the openings. The paper should be pressed
on while the paste is still moist, and the paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
itself should, of course, not be pasted at all. It
should be placed with colour side next to the
openings.</p>

<p>When the paste is dry the card-board should be
lightly scored on the lines AE, BF, etc., and bent
on these lines, bringing the sectors together into
the form of the shade and fastening them at the
top and bottom temporarily with a bit of passe-partout
binding. If the binding is of the ordinary
width (<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of an inch), it should be cut lengthwise
into two strips of equal width, to be used for mounting
the edges. No attempt should be made to
run the binding along more than one edge. The
separated strips should then be cut the exact length
for each top and bottom edge and applied one at
a time. Then the side edges are bound, with the
apex of the angle at the middle of the binding.
When the binding is firmly fastened it is carefully
trimmed off at the top and bottom.</p>


<h3>ELECTRIC LIGHT PENDANTS</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_408.jpg" width="300" height="280" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A seven-light fixture</div>
</div>

<p>Two designs for such pendants are illustrated in
the accompanying drawings. They were derived
from suggestions in the <i>Craftsman</i>, and were
successfully worked out in remodelling a house.
The seven-light fixture consists of a circular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
pendant-board about 30 inches in diameter, made
from 2-inch plain oak stock, cut into 60-degree
segments and, with splined joints, glued up to
form a circular piece which was turned up on
a large lathe. An open space 7 inches in diameter
was left in the larger circle, which was
covered by a cup-shaped cap turned from plain
oak stock and attached
to the larger circle by
screws. The considerable
opening covered
by this cap contained
the cut out and the
wiring necessary for
connecting with each
of the seven lights.
Seven medium-sized
hooks of composition metal were procured which
had large, coarse threaded screws. A <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-inch hole
was drilled lengthwise through the shanks of these
hooks. Holes were bored near the centre of the
arc of each segment in the board circle to receive
these hooks. When the fixture was assembled the
wires for each light were carried from the cut out
across a channel made for that purpose on the
upper surface of the board, passed down through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
the hole in the shank of the hook, woven into the
links of the chain pendant and connected with the corresponding
bulb socket after passing through another
hook, like those described above, which linked
the socket to the chain. As a finish around the
hooks shallow cups of beaten copper were fashioned
over a wooden form, turned for the purpose, and
oxidized to a tone somewhat
darker than the brown of the
oak board. Copper cups in a
conventional petal design were
made to place over each of the
bulbs. The chains were also
oxidized to conform with the
other metal work. The entire
combination was satisfactory.</p>

<img src="images/i_409.jpg" width="618" height="716" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A five-light fixture</div>
</div>

<p>Another design for the dining-room of the same
house and much easier to construct is also illustrated.
It will be observed that the square form
instead of the circle is carried out consistently in
the woodwork and metal caps. These caps and
the chains are in natural brass of a dull finish.
The shades are of ground glass, decorated with a
flower design in heavy black lines. The central
light has a larger shade than the others, wholly
enclosed. In this one is placed a red incandescent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
bulb for use whenever such decorative effect is
desired.</p>


<h3>DECORATIVE FORGINGS</h3>

<p>In the story of the designing and building of the
model house reference was made to contributions
from the forge shop. Among these were the andirons,
door knocker, lantern bracket, and other articles
shown in the accompanying illustrations.</p>

<p>It should be understood that all wrought iron work
that has any reality in it requires an equipment
especially adapted to its production. There must
be a good forge and fire, an anvil, and proper tools,
all in the hands of a workman of some experience
and skill. Successful forge work can hardly be
considered among the handicrafts easily adapted
to the needs of the amateur working without instruction
and with poor equipment. But with
good tools, proper equipment, and a little experience
any clever boy will be able to design and fashion
many useful articles for the home which have real
artistic merit.</p>

<div class="capl">[Plate XVI]</div>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>For the fireplace, in addition to andirons, there
may be made the shovel, poker, and tongs, and
possibly the old-fashioned crane and pot hooks.
Other fixtures that may be made are ceiling hooks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
lantern brackets for the wall or for lantern posts,
standards for the newel post, the hall lantern or
the porch lantern, the latch and the knocker for
the door, and, if the architectural design permits,
hinges, plates, and bolts for the door. This list
by no means exhausts the uses of wrought iron in
house decoration. It may be extended to include
draw pulls, key escutcheons, furniture handles
and hinges of great variety, nails with ornamental
heads for use with heavy construction, and many
small articles such as trivets for steam kettles,
toasting forks, candle holders, and many other
useful articles which have also decorative value.</p>

<small>CONCLUDING SUGGESTIONS</small></h2>

<h3>COUNTRY HOMES</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>To know what you prefer, instead of humbly saying amen to what the
world tells you you ought to prefer, is to have kept your soul alive.&mdash;<i>Robert Louis Stevenson</i>
</p></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Keen</span> observers of American customs, who
have studied the development of our taste
in house designing and furnishing, tell us
that the best expression of our art in architecture and
home decoration is to be found in our country homes.
They do not overlook, of course, a beautiful public
building in this city or that, perhaps ten altogether,
or an occasional private residence on Millionaire
Avenue, which are monuments to the genius of
the men who created them and of which any country
may be proud. What they mean is that as a people
we seek and secure the right combination of utility
and beauty in our homes more frequently in the
country than in the city.</p>

<p>At first thought such a criticism may seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
be an exaggeration. Is it reasonable, we ask,
that people of good sense, such as most Americans
are, really succeed better in planning, building, and
decorating the houses which they are to occupy
but a few weeks in the summer than they do in
developing their city homes? We are told that
it is true and that there are good reasons for it.</p>

<p><i>Simplicity of Country Life.</i>&mdash;It is the life in the
country and at the seashore that is the simple life,
the natural life, the life that sets us free from the
accumulated burden of mere "things." Here we come
to forget for a time the many and find pleasure in the
few. Here we are to feel the joy of living. Nature
is all about us, and she gives of her bounty freely.
Our wants are few because we are so well satisfied
with the free gifts. What wants we have keep
step with our needs here as they do nowhere else.
We care less for what others have; we are
more individual, more rational. Here we generally
demand what we really need and we more frequently
obtain it. And this is true whether it be
something that appeals to the &aelig;sthetic side of
our natures or whether it be that which ministers
to our material needs. In seeking the beautiful
for the simple home in the country we do not so
often forget the useful; for here, away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
world of museums and studios and collections, we
learn that art is possible without paintings and
statuary. In the exterior form and colouring of
the shingled cottage, set like a gem on the hillside
or by the sea, in the harmonious arrangement of
its interiors, with every article of furniture chosen
only for use and comfort and placed where needed,
and with decorations, cheerful but restrained and
subordinate, suggestive of more glorious colours
and more interesting things in the world without&mdash;in
such surroundings we have beauty and utility
combined. Here we have the time and the opportunity
to realize the truth that all art is one
and that it may find in the problems of decoration
in the country home, if not its highest mission,
its most open field for giving to appreciative people
the pleasure of seeing and enjoying the beautiful.</p>

<p><i>Opportunities for Constructive Art.</i>&mdash;If it be true
that there is a more universal recognition of the
true principles of art in the better class of our
country homes than in our city homes, it is proof,
if proof be needed, that the elements of art expression
are found in the simple, natural materials
of every-day life. It may be that in the development
of art amid simple surroundings "necessity
is the mother of invention," and that, more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
naturally, simplicity is thrust upon us. The general
habit of our time is to extend the vacation period
in the country or at the seashore to the point of
making a home there for every summer season.
But only a few can carry wealth and elegance with
them. A great majority must be satisfied with
simple and inexpensive homes. At first we accept
them as the only thing possible, and then we discover
that in their very simplicity they offer the
best of opportunities for true &aelig;sthetic expression.
And this opportunity is largely for the younger
members of the family&mdash;for the boys and girls
whose vacation period is more extended, whose interest
in the summer home is perhaps the more
vital and whose imagination is the more susceptible
to the art suggestions of nature. We have
seen that it is possible for boys and girls to build
and furnish a house under the exacting requirements
of city life. How much easier it must be
to build a cottage for the summer season, decorating
and furnishing it in harmony with the simple
needs of a vacation home.</p>

<p>If such a suggestion meet with acceptance, those
who undertake the work will find much practical
help in the problems outlined in the foregoing
chapters. It is not expected, of course, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
directions there given will always be exactly followed.
In the furniture problems, for example,
soft woods like pine and spruce may be substituted
for the harder woods specified. Very attractive as
well as very useful simple furniture has been made
in this way at a merely nominal expense. Staining
and finishing may easily bring it into harmony with
colour schemes; but the bright, fresh colour of
new pine and spruce is in itself by no means unattractive.
The smooth, exposed beams of the ceilings
and walls, if of well chosen stock, may be
stained a beautiful gray green or a soft brown.
A good colour suggestion may be found in the
weathered gray of the hewn timbers of very old
buildings. The effect of a ceiled-up wall or of a
dado may be easily obtained by stretching burlap
or denim over the studding or over a backing of
inexpensive sheathing. These materials are very
durable and inexpensive, and they may be found
in a great variety of beautiful shades. They make
excellent porti&egrave;res. A lighter, thinner material
like scrim is better for window draperies. All
these fabrics afford good surfaces for decoration
by stencilling. Stained or painted soft wood floors,
covered with grass cloth rugs or the more dainty
hand woven rugs like those described in the chapter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
on weaving, with simple, useful furniture, a picture
or two, and a few choice pieces of pottery, complete
the equipment for a charming living room. If
it all be the product of home industry, the cash
outlay for the material need not be over forty
dollars, though an outlay of ten times that amount
for better materials would not in the least interfere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
with such a room being decorated and furnished
by the unaided labours of the amateur artists
and craftsmen of the family.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption">A fireplace in field rock</div>
</div>

<p>The chief expense would naturally be for the
living room, dining-room, and kitchen. The dining-room,
however, may well be simply a corner
or alcove of a large living room. Such an arrangement
greatly increases the value of a single fireplace,
which will be required to give the summer
home the sense of perfect comfort. This may be
of rough field rock and should be large enough to
take one-cut fireplace wood. The chamber furnishings
may be very simple indeed. Furniture
dealers make a point of supplying beds, bureaus,
chairs, and cabinets of simple design, unfinished,
so that the purchaser may stain them to harmonize
with any desired colour scheme. But such furniture,
or good substitutes for it, can be made very
inexpensively. For example, the stock for a good
bed will not cost over seventy-five cents. Cases
provided with shelves and curtains in place of
drawers, made at a cash outlay possibly of one
dollar, will serve for bureaus. The cost of materials
for building an eight-room cottage in every way
satisfactory need not exceed five hundred dollars;
and such a cottage could be beautifully furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
by clever boys and girls at an expense for materials
of one hundred and fifty or perhaps two hundred
dollars.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_421.jpg" width="500" height="339" alt="" />
<div class="caption">An inexpensive bed</div>
</div>

<p>In the exterior finishing of summer cottages
nature generally needs very little assistance. No
colours harmonize so well with the gray rocks,
sere fields and marshes, and the evergreen trees
by the seashore, as the weathered grays of the
shingled cottage. The window frames, door frames
and facings, painted to preserve them, may be of
the same colour or in dull green or brown, plainly
marking the outlines of the house but without
unpleasant contrasts. A stained roof in slate gray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
or creosote brown is also in keeping. The underpinning
and outside chimneys in the field rock of
the locality are eminently fitting. The house
among the hills will stand more colour because the
colours of nature are richer, especially in the autumn
season. But wherever the house may be,
it should repeat in its larger surfaces the prevailing
colour tones of its natural setting. It should seem
to fit into its surroundings as if it belonged there
and would always remain there, a part of the simple,
natural beauty all around it.</p>
